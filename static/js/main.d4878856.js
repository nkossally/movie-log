This does not diminish the movie, which is pretty damn good. The title of the movie suggests it\u2019s about Hannah, played by Mia Farrow, and her two sisters, played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest. But it\u2019s also about the men in their lives: Woody Allen, Michael Caine, and Max von Sydow. In fact, after the opening ensemble scene, Woody Allen gives Woody Allen the first extended segment that is just about a single character, Woody Allen. Allen plays a hypochondriac who is very similar to Woody Allen. As for the women, Hannah/Mia Farrow, is the least important and least interesting character among the three sisters. She is the perfect, successful sister. Dianne Wiest is the struggling, temperamental artist. And Barbara Hershey is the impulsive beauty who just blows with the wind, having affairs with older professors, taking random classes at Columbia University because she has no direction in life, driven only by libido and vague intellectual interests. The sisters are well written and have believable sisterly dynamics. The less believable aspects of the sister characters derive from Allen\u2019s perversity. For example, Woody Allen is Farrow\u2019s ex-husband. After they split, Farrow encourages Allen to date Dianne Wiest. I don\u2019t know anyone who would set their sister up with their ex-husband. In addition, Barbara Hershey has a secret affair with Mia Farrow\u2019s husband. This is all weird bohemian behavior, but the film presents the affairs as if they\u2019re just what adults do. The sisters have near incestuous relationships despite appearing to be normal, well-adjusted, upper-middle-class people (except Wiest, who is half crazy). The lack of boundaries of the women is odd, but Woody Allen presents them as normal. I think Allen has incestuous interests, and he normalizes inappropriate relationships by grafting his inappropriate feelings onto the women in the movie. This is a common trick of Allen\u2019s. He puts his dark hedonism and mean-spiritedness into women characters. That\u2019s why his female characters are very interesting. Much more interesting than the males. "),"Allen wrote a lot of great Oscar winning parts for women, but his films are not always kind to women.

I do not think Hannah, who is kind and empathic, would be so dismissive of this common experience of aging beauties. But I think Allen would. In addition, at one point, Dianne Wiest\u2019s character remarks on how she is not sixteen anymore. I do not know any woman over thirty who thinks sixteen was their best year. But I think Allen thinks sixteen is the peak age of a girl/woman. The characters in ").concat(pt," Hannah and Her Sisters ").concat(gt," are well-written, but Allen assigns them a bit too much misogyny that exists in him, not the characters."),"As for Allen\u2019s character, he is practically in a different movie. His scenes are all comedic, while most other scenes are dramatic. Allen plays a hypochondriac who thinks he is dying, learns that he is not, and then tries out several religions in search of the meaning of life while still running from death. Just as in reality, Allen\u2019s character is a narcissist. His fear of death stems from self-absorption. His character explicitly states in voice-over that it is impossible that he can live in a city as great as New York and yet face death. I think the character and the person, Woody Allen, have some sort of megalomania that makes death hard to fathom. His megalomania is bizarrely tethered to his identity as a New Yorker. This is all played for laughs, but Allen\u2019s comedic scenes are the darkest of all.","".concat(pt," Hannah and Her Sisters ").concat(gt," probably shouldn\u2019t work as a movie, but it does because of Allen\u2019s ingenious insertions of his light-but-morbid comedic scenes between the dramatic ones. Without his scenes, ").concat(pt," Hannah\u2026 ").concat(gt," would be a tepid melodrama. With Allen\u2019s scenes, it becomes great. Hannah\u2026 feels like an adult movie because the tension between comedy and melodrama feels a lot like the complexity of life, which has twists and turns, and inevitably ends one way. Allen\u2019s character is obsessed with death, while the women are alive, actively keeping their family together, pursuing love or pursuing art. Eventually, Allen\u2019s death-chasing character falls in love with Wiest, and he is alive again. Allen finds a woman to revive him. He finds a woman to suck the life out of. Aside from starting a new relationship with Wiest, Allen\u2019s character recovers from fear of death by going to the movies, enjoying cinematic entertainment, and realizing that he should chase joy instead of death. Once again, Allen reveals his self-importance. Of course, the movies are a reason to live because Allen, in reality, made so many of them. Allen\u2019s character, and Allen the person, like all narcissists, need something to feed their egos and beat back their insecurities. He and his character need the concept of the greatness of their profession, and they need sex and romance (with Wiest in the movie, and with his partner\u2019s daughter in reality)."),"Hannah/Farrow is the nicest character in ".concat(pt," Hannah and Her Sisters.

Farrow is so nice that she is marginal. Allen\u2019s covertly mean character gets far more screen time than the titular character. In one scene, Allen\u2019s character is depressed about the inevitability of death and he scoffs at the adults around him jogging in a park, trying to stay fit and, in Allen\u2019s mind, stave off the decline of the body. Allen\u2019s character is especially mean to a fat person jogging, because fat people couldn\u2019t possibly have a reason to live. I think these are the real feelings of Woody Allen. Fear of aging, fear of death, and fear of fatness are the fears and insecurities of the narcissist and the pedophile. Allen is remarkably honest in his films about his darkness, and dishonest at the same time. He is direct and indirect. Sometimes the women characters in his films voice his darkness. Sometimes he himself, in character that is, voices his darkness, with comedy to lighten the dark. Woody Allen is so mean and petty. He hates old people. He hates fat people. He can neither grasp his own mortality nor the existence of other people outside of himself, so all of his characters are expressions of himself. This dramedy is a beautiful crystallization of his pettiness. This is a great movie, I think."),"Side note: In Allen\u2019s first scene, a television producer informs him that a sketch on child molestation is inappropriate. Another producer suggests that they televise a gay joke instead, because, apparently, homosexuality is one step below pedophilia in indecency.

While typically frustrating, these Wes Andersonisms work here because the characters work. The characters are fleshed out and human. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is a narcissist who abandoned his family when his children were young, and tries to reinsert himself into their lives when he falls into financial ruin later in life.

Most scenes in this movie consist of people talking in rooms. Soderbergh\u2019s camerawork makes these scenes thrilling. There\u2019s a scene in which Cate Blanchett has a hostile therapy session with Naomi Harris. At first, whenever the camera shows both faces on screen, the camera is angled to make Blanchett appear physically higher, suggesting her dominance. Once Blanchett finally shows some vulnerability, we see a medium close-up of her. The shots are all controlled and deliberate and convey what they should convey. This is not A-level Soderbergh, but it is solid B+.","The movie poses as a spy thriller, but it is really a story about a marriage. Fassbender stars as a British intelligence officer tasked with finding the leak of a top-secret computer program. His wife, Cate Blanchett, is one of four suspects. Movies, generally, are full of metaphors. This movie\u2019s primary metaphor compares marriage to spying. Fassbender and Blanchet are partners working for the same agency, but they must keep secrets from each other for professional reasons. This mirrors how certain old-school heterosexual relationships are built by the concept of mystery. Cate Blanchett is always feminine and mysterious to Fassbender, and he can\u2019t get enough of her. In an agency filled with professional liars who fail at relationships, they are the ideal couple.","There is a problem with how this movie uses the spy thriller genre as a metaphor for marriage. Half of the metaphor is underbaked. The spy stuff is not as interesting as the marriage stuff. [SPOILER-START] There\u2019s almost no action.

[SPOILER-END] A better movie would discuss the relationship of Blanchett and Fassbender in relation to the larger institution. A better movie may even venture into institutional analysis. At the very least, a better movie would have action scenes as tense as the dinner party scenes. ","Side note: Like many films, this film celebrates materialism and sociopathy.

River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves are two hustlers sitting at a diner. Phoenix is in love with Reeves, and Reeves only thinks of Phoenix as a friend. We see them as if we are at the table with them. Then we see them through the window of the diner. This is a simple and often used filming technique. Looking through a window can mean many things in film. Here, it can stand for how evasive Keanu Reeves is. It can also symbolize how we never fully see the ones we love. Personally, I am not interested settling what the shot means. I think the shot stands on its own, without meaning. It is beautiful, and so are many shots in this movie. Shortly after the Phoenix and Reeves leave the diner, we see them ride a motorcycle, Reeves in front, Phoenix behind. This shot is also beautiful. It captures how it feels to be young and pretty and with somebody pretty and with nothing much to do all day. The shots. The sets. The costumes. The actors. All are much prettier than the story the movie tells. The prettiness contrasts with the content, and this disturbs me a bit.","River Phoenix was an ultimate crush object in the 90s who stars in this movie as an ultimate crush object. He is a sweet, sensitive sex worker who is extra vulnerable because he has narcolepsy (hence he may not recall nor be paid for some of his sexual \u201cencounters\u201d). Phoenix sleepwalks through his working-class life high on drugs with false memories of a mother who abandoned him, and no control over what happens to him. In addition, romantic love does not offer him a way out, because his crush object, Keanu Reeves, [SPOILER-START] is the son of the Mayor of Portland, and is merely slumming it as a sex worker, prior to rejoining respectable straight society. [SPOILER-END] Phoenix is trapped. No love. No prospects. No support. Just an endless set of encounters with predators (including Reeves) who take advantage of him.","[TITLE-START] My Own Private Idaho [TITLE-END] is one of those movies about the harshness of working-class life. Movies like these tend to have some aspect that softens the harshness. Family love, romantic love, upward mobility and/or a happy ending are possible softeners. This film doesn\u2019t offer those. It offers aesthetics. It is very pretty. This film is loosely based on several Shakespeare plays, so the impoverished sex workers occasionally rattle off philosophical musings in iambic pentameter. The language and visual language of the film are highly stylized. The stylization is supposed to make the tragedy of River Phoenix\u2019s character beautiful and palatable. Unfortunately, in reality, River Phoenix died of an overdose at the age twenty-three one year after the release of this film. It is hard to admire the stylized tragedy of the character he plays when his actual life ended tragically. My problem with [TITLE-START] My Own Private Idaho [TITLE-END] is how the fictional story interacts with both the reality of Phoenix\u2019s death, and the reality of lives of the most dispossessed sex workers. Aesthetics and style are cool, but not moral.","Perhaps I would like this movie more if it had something positive to say about queers, but I don\u2019t think it does. The most sympathetic queers in this film are young, pretty, thin, and masculine presenting. The bad predatory queers, on the other hand, are feminine and middle aged. This is yet another reason I don\u2019t think this film has its heart in the right place \u2013 another reason I can\u2019t enjoy the excessive vulnerability of Phoenix\u2019s body to the predatory camera. Aesthetically, this film is a 10/10. I bump it down to a 9 because it makes me uncomfortable.","Side note: The sex scenes are emblematic of what I take to be the deep-seated anti-humanism of this movie. They only last a few seconds and consist of still shots in which the actors pose in sexual positions motionlessly. The sex scenes are like stills in a magazine. They are eerie and alienating. As if sex is just posturing and pictures, not a life-affirming act. Perhaps the film is commenting on the commodification of sex and sex-workers. Perhaps it is reveling in it.

In [TITLE-START] Georgia, [TITLE-END] Leigh plays a drug addicted failed punk singer who has a strained relationship with her more successful folk singer sister, Mare Winningham, the titular Georgia. The movie is very independent, very slice of life, very wise about how siblings hate and love each other, and accurate about the lifestyles of failed musicians and the lumpen proletarians that surround them. Jennifer Jason Leigh is great. She is the best part of the movie. Her acting is nuanced. I don\u2019t always like method acting, but I like how she does it. As much as I am impressed by Daniel Day Lewis, I don\u2019t really like him. By contrast, I am both impressed with and enjoy Leigh\u2019s 90\u2019s era approach to method acting. She does the method acting tics, but does not lose touch with the humanity of her characters, and never seems to try to take focus away from the people and objects in the frame of the camera. She has a generous presence on film, even when her characters are selfish and melodramatic. I get the sense that Leigh is more committed to story and the profession of acting than to ego.","When I first watched this film as a teenager, I identified with the obnoxious-drug-addict-dreamer Leigh plays, and hated her well-adjusted, middle-class sister. In my thirties, I still sort of hate the older sister, but I get her. And I get why the aging members of the Academy identified with Winningham and gave her a prize for putting up with Leigh. Leigh is an annoying adult who does not want the responsibilities of an adult in a capitalist system. Then again, neither do I.","Side note 1: Another way this movie has changed for me over the course of the decades between my viewings is I have a buzzword called \u201cnarcissist\u201d that I can use to describe Leigh\u2019s character. Like all buzzwords, narcissist is more reductive than descriptive. Leigh\u2019s performance is too nuanced to be reduced to a DSM/YouTube term. Still, the term applies. It probably applies to most musicians.","Side note 2: This movie is too slow and indie for the TikTok generation, I think.

I liked this movie when it was released in 2002, and, with nostalgic grade inflation, I might love it now.","The writer of [TITLE-START] Phone Booth [TITLE-END] originally conceived the film as a paranoid thriller for Alfred Hitchcock to direct. The movie Joel Schumacher ultimately directed decades after Hitchcock\u2019s death is a little bit paranoid. The paranoia in the movie is over cell phones and other telecommunications technology. The villain in the film is the sniper on the other line of the phone booth call. He could represent the inherent alienation of long-distance communication. He could represent radiation, because ordinary people feared cell phone towers caused radiation in the early 2000s. He could represent many other things. Movies are metaphors for many things.","To me, the most interesting aspect of the sniper is that he helps Farrell become a better person by putting on a live morality play that involves the cops and the press as characters. [SPOILER-START] The sniper releases Farrell from the threat of death once Farrell performs an uncharacteristic selfless act. Farrell\u2019s moral victory and personal growth come at a cost of two men\u2019s lives and dozens of total working hours of dozens of cops, but at least Farrell learned to be nice. [SPOILER-END] The \u201cmorality\u201d of the evil sniper softens the paranoia of the film. Sure, phone calls with serial killers are scary. But you just might learn to be a better person.","Just as the movie is ambivalent about its villain, I think it\u2019s ambivalent about tech. As it turns out, the tech in this film is used to accomplish something old-fashioned and conservative \u2013 convince Colin Farrell to stop being a publicist who emotionally cheats on his blonde wife with a dark-haired Katie Holmes, and get him to be a good, domesticated family man. One way to domesticate and naturalize new tech is to use it to achieve conservative ends.","Side note 1: I like to think about how films bend time and space. This film, like the show 24, which was airing at the time, occurs in real time. One minute in real time is one minute in the movie. This film also has many other relationships to time. Due to the history of the screenplay, it grafts Cold War era paranoia onto early 2000s techno-paranoia. Finally, the film is a time capsule.

For example, Deadpool jokes about the failure of MCU\u2019s multiverse. The joke is based on how, for the past several years, Disney reduced all of the cosmic potential of the multiverse to an excuse to retcon characters and plots. The multiverse is a lazy way to staple together an endless amount of Marvel films fans feel obligated to see. Disney corporatized the multiverse. But Disney did not make sense of the multiverse. I don\u2019t understand any of the time and space travel in this movie, and I don\u2019t think the writers do either. This movie is a joke delivery machine, so the world building and the plot do not matter, so long as the jokes hit.

This film critiques the idea of America by telling the story of a brilliant architect, Adrien Brody, who flees Hungary during the Holocaust, works low wage jobs, and eventually secures an architectural contract with morally dubious capitalist, Guy Pearce. Towards the beginning of the movie, Brody arrives at Ellis Island, and viewers of the film see the Statue of Liberty from Brody\u2019s point of view, upside down. This iconic shot is a blunt but effective metaphor for the broken promise of the American dream. There are a lot of blunt metaphors in this film. I am happy with bluntness, and blunt metaphors in particular (see The Substance for another 2024 blunt metaphor movie). I love metaphors and symbols and synecdoches and so does director Brady Corbet. Adrien Brody is a symbol of the immigrant experience. His architectural projects are expressions of the artist\u2019s need to create something permanent that outlives the artist. His solid and fixed architectural constructs are also a metaphor for the Jewish search for a permanent home. Brody designs a community center that looks like a concentration camp. The meanings of that metaphor are abundant.",text3:"[SPOILER-START] One of the metaphors of the film is overwrought. Towards the end of the film, Guy Pearce rapes Adrien Brody. This moment fleshed out Pearce\u2019s character pretty well. Perhaps he is a self-hating homo for whom homosexual sex has to be degrading. He is both attracted to Brody\u2019s Eastern Europeanness and repulsed. He is an unimpressive capitalist who figuratively and literally rapes his workers. The literalness of the rape is a story choice, and the idea isn\u2019t strong enough to justify the upsetting scene. Everyone is critical of capitalists these days. We understand that capitalists are bad whether they are rapists or not. In addition, the rape scene would function better if no character ever commented on it again. That would be realistic. But the rape scene turns out to be pivotal in a manner that feels lazy and unearned.

My opinion is the line is precisely the kind of statement I\u2019d expect a chic presenter at an art gallery to say; a simple inversion of clich\xe9 is automatically considered poignant and evocative. The film, and journey vs. destination line, are about the search for a home by Jewish refugees. The film is ambivalent about whether America or Israel are proper homes for Jewish people.

LaKeith Stanfield starts the film as an abstract thinker, wondering about his impact on the world. His girlfriend, Tessa Thompson is an artist living in the present, grounded and in tune with the community around her. LaKeith is narcissistic and succumbs to betraying his coworkers when offered a high salary. Tessa is moral and loyal. In addition to depicting this abstract male vs. earthy female binary, Boots Riley also subjects Tessa Thompson to physical and sexual humiliation in one scene.

This movie establishes the lore of Tom Cruise\u2019s troubled relationships with women. Very rapidly, the movie explains away that Cruise is getting married to Michelle Monaghan. Monaghan, unlike Thandie Newton of Mission II, is white. The film also explains away that Cruise has a platonic relationship with agent Keri Russell, who, unlike Thandie Newton, is white. It doesn\u2019t really matter who these women are, or what qualities endear them to Cruise. It just matters that this film plants the seed that Cruise will eventually not be able to reconcile having women in his life with the danger of his profession. As for the race of the women, that matters because of the movement of Cruise away from being a sex symbol over the course of the franchise. Mission II positioned Cruise as a James Bond-like stud, so it was okay then for him to screw around with Thandie Newton. Mission III presents Cruise with the possibility of marriage and domesticity, so Monaghan is more appropriate.",text2:"In addition to women as motivation, this sequel ups the ante of Cruise\u2019s longstanding war with skyscrapers. He doesn\u2019t just break into a skyscraper by hanging from rope. Here, he trapezes between skyscrapers in Shanghai using rope. Cruise\u2019s battles against human constructs (e.g. buildings, bridges, roads, trains) are more compelling than his battles against, say, a cliff in Mission II. The image of man vs. skyscraper is symbolic of Cruise\u2019s role in the IMF (No. Not the International Monetary Fund. The Impossible Mission Force!) He is responsible to the IMF, yet he can choose to accept or reject any mission. There is a hierarchy of authority in the IMF, yet Cruise constantly violates mission command. Cruise is the ultimate insider. He is a secret agent in an intelligence agency more elite than the C.I.A. with the ability to infiltrate any institution in any country at will. Yet Cruise cannot fully trust the institution to which he belongs. [SPOILER-START] This is the second Mission Impossible in which one of the bad guys turned out to be one of Cruise\u2019s bosses at the IMF. [SPOILER-END] In addition, this film lays groundwork for the lore that Cruise cannot integrate himself into normal boring suburban life because of his profession. Cruise is a very powerful super-American and also alienated from everyone else. He needs to be a perfect soldier and his superhuman skills separate him from ordinary beings. He is above the institution. He is above everything and everyone, fighting for what he thinks is just. He is completely alone.

When Crudup explains his master plan to Cruise, he calls Fishbourne a \u201cdiversity hire.\u201d I am not sure why this line is in the film. It can be interpreted various ways. Crudup is a bad guy, so his resentment of black people isn\u2019t validated by the film, necessarily. Later on, after the plot resolves, Fishbourne apologizes to Cruise for being a hard-ass and Fishbourne literally says that he owes Cruise \u201creparations.\u201d It is very bad word choice for a black character to tell Cruise that he owes Cruise reparations. This is a slip up, but a telling one. [SPOILER-END] The Mission Impossible series is mostly apolitical and therefore has no space or time to comment on anything as fraught as race. The series is about the power of the individual over and above institutions. Sure, Cruise works for an institution called the IMF, but he is above it. Sure, Cruise is a white man with American citizenship who flies into other countries to carry out espionage on behalf of the United States, but it\u2019s not about empire building. It\u2019s about saving the world from bad guys. Mission Impossible is uninterested in institutional thinking, so it is jarring when Billy Crudup\u2019s comment stirs thoughts about institutional racism. That line, like the reparations line, was a mistake. It\u2019s easier to accept that Thandie Newton was put in the fuck box and Monaghan was put in the marriage box if race is presumed and not stated out loud.",text4:"Side-note 2: Race aside, there is slight, but ultimately deceptive evidence of political thinking in this film via the Crudup character. In a convoluted way, Crudup wanted bad guy Phillip Seymour Hoffman to have weapons so the U.S. could use that as an excuse to launch preemptive war. This plot point may be a response to the War in Iraq, but it\u2019s just plot. It\u2019s a throwaway line that reduces \u201cterrorist\u201d threat to the conspiracies of bad men.

Depending on personal taste, they can falter on a story level. I like the story here, but it has a limitation. There is no narrative tension except for watching the inevitable unfold. Everything is foretold early on. In addition, we are all familiar with the vampire lore this film makes no attempt to update. As in The Witch, I don\u2019t think Eggers is interested in updating familiar mythologies. He reproduces them. Hence the lack of tension. There are no surprises. But there is a compelling depiction of a woman struggling with whether she is good or evil because she has sexual desires for a disgusting creature.

Grant is a fugitive sizing up a man who may be foe or friend. The camera shows Grant. Then it shows the man. Then there\u2019s a beautiful symmetric shot of the men looking at each other, with the road in the center of the frame running into the horizon. Then close ups of Grant from a different angle.

Bale is probably a stand-in for Haynes, and Meyers is based on David Bowie. The film, in part, depicts Haynes\u2019 own queer coming of age journey by way of sexual obsession with pop stars.

This does not diminish the movie, which is pretty damn good.

But it\u2019s also about the men in their lives: Woody Allen, Michael Caine, and Max von Sydow. In fact, after the opening ensemble scene, Woody Allen gives Woody Allen the first extended segment that is just about a single character, Woody Allen. Allen plays a hypochondriac who is very similar to Woody Allen. As for the women, Hannah/Mia Farrow, is the least important and least interesting character among the three sisters. She is the perfect, successful sister. Dianne Wiest is the struggling, temperamental artist. And Barbara Hershey is the impulsive beauty who just blows with the wind, having affairs with older professors, taking random classes at Columbia University because she has no direction in life, driven only by libido and vague intellectual interests. The sisters are well written and have believable sisterly dynamics. The less believable aspects of the sister characters derive from Allen\u2019s perversity. For example, Woody Allen is Farrow\u2019s ex-husband. After they split, Farrow encourages Allen to date Dianne Wiest. I don\u2019t know anyone who would set their sister up with their ex-husband. In addition, Barbara Hershey has a secret affair with Mia Farrow\u2019s husband. This is all weird bohemian behavior, but the film presents the affairs as if they\u2019re just what adults do. The sisters have near incestuous relationships despite appearing to be normal, well-adjusted, upper-middle-class people (except Wiest, who is half crazy). The lack of boundaries of the women is odd, but Woody Allen presents them as normal. I think Allen has incestuous interests, and he normalizes inappropriate relationships by grafting his inappropriate feelings onto the women in the movie. This is a common trick of Allen\u2019s. He puts his dark hedonism and mean-spiritedness into women characters. That\u2019s why his female characters are very interesting. Much more interesting than the males.

In addition, at one point, Dianne Wiest\u2019s character remarks on how she is not sixteen anymore. I do not know any woman over thirty who thinks sixteen was their best year. But I think Allen thinks sixteen is the peak age of a girl/woman. The characters in ").concat(Tt," Hannah and Her Sisters ").concat(St," are well-written, but Allen assigns them a bit too much misogyny that exists in him, not the characters."),"As for Allen\u2019s character, he is practically in a different movie. His scenes are all comedic, while most other scenes are dramatic. Allen plays a hypochondriac who thinks he is dying, learns that he is not, and then tries out several religions in search of the meaning of life while still running from death. Just as in reality, Allen\u2019s character is a narcissist. His fear of death stems from self-absorption. His character explicitly states in voice-over that it is impossible that he can live in a city as great as New York and yet face death.

Eventually, Allen\u2019s death-chasing character falls in love with Wiest, and he is alive again. Allen finds a woman to revive him. He finds a woman to suck the life out of. Aside from starting a new relationship with Wiest, Allen\u2019s character recovers from fear of death by going to the movies, enjoying cinematic entertainment, and realizing that he should chase joy instead of death. Once again, Allen reveals his self-importance. Of course, the movies are a reason to live because Allen, in reality, made so many of them. Allen\u2019s character, and Allen the person, like all narcissists, need something to feed their egos and beat back their insecurities.

In one scene, Allen\u2019s character is depressed about the inevitability of death and he scoffs at the adults around him jogging in a park, trying to stay fit and, in Allen\u2019s mind, stave off the decline of the body. Allen\u2019s character is especially mean to a fat person jogging, because fat people couldn\u2019t possibly have a reason to live. I think these are the real feelings of Woody Allen. Fear of aging, fear of death, and fear of fatness are the fears and insecurities of the narcissist and the pedophile. Allen is remarkably honest in his films about his darkness, and dishonest at the same time. He is direct and indirect. Sometimes the women characters in his films voice his darkness. Sometimes he himself, in character that is, voices his darkness, with comedy to lighten the dark. Woody Allen is so mean and petty. He hates old people. He hates fat people.

It offers aesthetics. It is very pretty. This film is loosely based on several Shakespeare plays, so the impoverished sex workers occasionally rattle off philosophical musings in iambic pentameter.

The joke is based on how, for the past several years, Disney reduced all of the cosmic potential of the multiverse to an excuse to retcon characters and plots. The multiverse is a lazy way to staple together an endless amount of Marvel films fans feel obligated to see. Disney corporatized the multiverse. But Disney did not make sense of the multiverse. I don\u2019t understand any of the time and space travel in this movie, and I don\u2019t think the writers do either. This movie is a joke delivery machine, so the world building and the plot do not matter, so long as the jokes hit.

The jokes are juvenile, and tepid enough to pass Disney\u2019s censor. The original Deadpool only pretended to be more dangerous than other superhero films. But it was always corporate.

This film critiques the idea of America by telling the story of a brilliant architect, Adrien Brody, who flees Hungary during the Holocaust, works low wage jobs, and eventually secures an architectural contract with morally dubious capitalist, Guy Pearce. Towards the beginning of the movie, Brody arrives at Ellis Island, and viewers of the film see the Statue of Liberty from Brody\u2019s point of view, upside down. This iconic shot is a blunt but effective metaphor for the broken promise of the American dream. There are a lot of blunt metaphors in this film. I am happy with bluntness, and blunt metaphors in particular (see The Substance for another 2024 blunt metaphor movie). I love metaphors and symbols and synecdoches and so does director Brady Corbet. Adrien Brody is a symbol of the immigrant experience. His architectural projects are expressions of the artist\u2019s need to create something permanent that outlives the artist. His solid and fixed architectural constructs are also a metaphor for the Jewish search for a permanent home. Brody designs a community center that looks like a concentration camp. The meanings of that metaphor are abundant.",text3:"[SPOILER-START] One of the metaphors of the film is overwrought. Towards the end of the film, Guy Pearce rapes Adrien Brody. This moment fleshed out Pearce\u2019s character pretty well. Perhaps he is a self-hating homo for whom homosexual sex has to be degrading. He is both attracted to Brody\u2019s Eastern Europeanness and repulsed. He is an unimpressive capitalist who figuratively and literally rapes his workers. The literalness of the rape is a story choice, and the idea isn\u2019t strong enough to justify the upsetting scene. Everyone is critical of capitalists these days. We understand that capitalists are bad whether they are rapists or not. In addition, the rape scene would function better if no character ever commented on it again. That would be realistic.

It just matters that this film plants the seed that Cruise will eventually not be able to reconcile having women in his life with the danger of his profession. As for the race of the women, that matters because of the movement of Cruise away from being a sex symbol over the course of the franchise.

Crudup is a bad guy, so his resentment of black people isn\u2019t validated by the film, necessarily. Later on, after the plot resolves, Fishbourne apologizes to Cruise for being a hard-ass and Fishbourne literally says that he owes Cruise \u201creparations.\u201d It is very bad word choice for a black character to tell Cruise that he owes Cruise reparations. This is a slip up, but a telling one. [SPOILER-END] The Mission Impossible series is mostly apolitical and therefore has no space or time to comment on anything as fraught as race. The series is about the power of the individual over and above institutions. Sure, Cruise works for an institution called the IMF, but he is above it. Sure, Cruise is a white man with American citizenship who flies into other countries to carry out espionage on behalf of the United States, but it\u2019s not about empire building. It\u2019s about saving the world from bad guys. Mission Impossible is uninterested in institutional thinking, so it is jarring when Billy Crudup\u2019s comment stirs thoughts about institutional racism.

Bale is probably a stand-in for Haynes, and Meyers is based on David Bowie. The film, in part, depicts Haynes\u2019 own queer coming of age journey by way of sexual obsession with pop stars.

As in other Grisham films, institutions (cops, FBI, White House) are corrupt, and an individual hero saves the day. Cruise not a pure hero. The film suggests that he could have been corrupted had he stayed at the firm. Cruise embodies the classic character trope of the poor boy running from his origins. He is born poor, his brother is in prison, and he married rich (Jeanne Tripplehorn). His rich wife is content to relinquish the perks of the firm because she always had money and does not covet it. (The dynamic is reminiscent of Leonardo DiCaprio/Cate Blanchett in Aviator, Jared Leto/Jennifer Connelly in Requiem for a Dream.)","As in Jerry Maguire, black people represent something for Cruise. Towards the beginning of the movie, Jeanne Tripplehorn notes that the firm is \u201call white, all male, all married.\u201d As she points out racial disparity, she and Cruise see a black kid on a sidewalk perform somersaults for pocket change. Cruise\u2019s stunt double does multiple somersaults beside the kid and then hi-fives him, because Cruise is kind of down, you know. Pretty hip and with it.
