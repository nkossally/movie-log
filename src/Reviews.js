  title="It Ends With Us"
  director="Justin Baldoni"
  writer=""
  date="04/24/2025"
  releaseDate="2024"
  paragraphs={[
    `It Ends with Us grossed $351 million at the box office, the 20th highest grossing movie of 2024. It is the only “women’s issues” film in the top twenty (besides, perhaps, Wicked), and it is one of only five non-sequels on the list. Money is the best way to talk about the film because it has more to say about money than it has to say about domestic abuse, the ostensible topic of the film. In It Ends, Blake Lively dates and marries Justin Baldoni, an abusive man. After several highly edited and glossed over scenes of physical and sexual violence, Lively leaves Baldoni and restarts her relationship with her high school ex. The characters have very few characteristics, but we do know how they make money. Baldoni is a surgeon and Lively is also wealthy. She owns a flower shop, which is more typical of a woman in a Rom-Com than a serious social drama. Lively is also the daughter of a mayor, so she is well-connected. She is financially independent, something many victims of domestic abuse are not. Lively also has a ruggedly handsome but sweet man’s arms to run into once she escapes Baldoni. She suffers abuse, but she, unlike many, has an escape route: money. We can see money in her consistently chic outfits. She wears the simple but elegant clothing rich people wear. She always has to look great, which is why the movie never shows the brutality of domestic abuse. It shows Lively putting on make-up afterwards, looking fantastic as usual, even with a slight bruise that only accentuates the beauty of her almond-shaped blue eyes. When Lively divorces Baldoni, she loses the status of a surgeon’s wife, but she presumably gets alimony and child support. In addition, the beautiful man she takes up with after leaving Baldoni owns a company of his own – a popular restaurant in Boston. Lively is never unglamorous in this movie about domestic abuse. She always has money.`,
    `It Ends with Us is an uninteresting movie that contributes nothing to the genre of domestic abuse films. Lively’s lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, and his countersuit, are far more interesting. In 2024, Lively sued Baldoni for inappropriate sexualized behavior on set, and for using a PR firm to smear her reputation online. In 2025, Baldoni countersued Lively for defamation, and claimed the Lively tried to take over production of It Ends. Most of the internet seems to have taken Baldoni’s side a year before trial starts. For the sake of social justice, it would be best if court ruled on Lively’s claims of workplace harassment before the court of public opinion litigated Lively’s personality. But the court of public opinion is faster than the state, and most of the Internet has ruled that Blake Lively is a bitch and Justin Baldoni a nice, soy-boy feminist, despite his playing the post-Me-Too antifeminist card of combating harassment claims with defamation claims. He is a great guy, despite using the very same PR firm that Johnny Depp used to destroy the reputation of Amber Heard and destroy the Hollywood division of the Me-Too movement. Lively and Baldoni are two combatants in the Hollywood system, so the harassment claims matter less than money. One or none of them will survive the extralegal battle to destroy the ability of the other to continue to earn Hollywood film star paychecks. The legal case is all about money, just like the movie whose production provoked the case, and just like movies in general. Domestic abuse cannot be reduced to money alone, but in Hollywood it can.`

    `Since the success of Get Out, audiences of black horror and black genre films have borne the burden of having to analyze what the movie monster symbolizes about racial capitalism in any black film. I felt the anxiety of having to catch and analyze every frame and bit of dialogue as I sat down in a theater during a matinee screening of Sinners on opening weekend. And then director Ryan Coogler surprised me. He introduced me to black businessmen arriving in Mississippi from Chicago, aiming to open a juke joint. He introduced me to the son of a preacher who prefers the Blues to the gospel. He introduced me to a local drunk who plays the piano. He introduced me to a fresh take on the tragic mulatto. He introduced me to black women who pursue and express sexual gratification. He introduced me to a community of sharecroppers that relieve their burdens with church or with drink and music. So, I stopped worrying about analysis because the movie is enough. This is a real movie. Not a sequel. Not a remake. Not a static art installation. Not a vehicle for politics. This is a movie to be experienced first, and analyzed later.`,
    `As for analysis, sure, the vampires represent something about race and class in America. The film is rich in images, sounds and ideas, so there must be many interpretations of them. Vampires have something to do with sinning and hedonistic escape from working-class life and racialized oppression. The post-credits scene in Sinners explicitly suggests Americans have no real access to freedom, but they do have music and dance. Sinners explicitly compares enjoying night life to vampirism. Vampires escape death, but are not free because they never see the light. Perhaps vampires are like addicts – people whose escapism lands them in a darker place. Ryan Coogler is a brilliant. These ideas are interesting. I am just glad this movie is movie-ish enough to overcome having to be about something to matter. It’s about so many things, but also, it’s a portrait of a community movie, a crazy night out movie, a vampire movie. Finally, the movies give us a real movie!`

  title="Hannah and Her Sisters"
  director="Woody Allen"
  writer="Woody Allen"
  date="04/12/2025"
  releaseDate="1986"
  paragraphs={[
    `It’s hard to watch Woody Allen movies these days without thinking about the pedophilia allegations and Allen’s marriage to the adopted daughter of his former partner. It’s hard not to look for signs of his disorder in his films, and there are plenty of signs in Hannah… of Allen’s morbid narcissism, which goes hand-in-hand with pedophilia, I think. This does not diminish the movie, which is pretty damn good. The title of the movie suggests it’s about Hannah, played by Mia Farrow, and her two sisters, played by Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest. But it’s also about the men in their lives: Woody Allen, Michael Caine, and Max von Sydow. In fact, after the opening ensemble scene, Woody Allen gives Woody Allen the first extended segment that is just about a single character, Woody Allen. Allen plays a hypochondriac who is very similar to Woody Allen. As for the women, Hannah/Mia Farrow, is the least important and least interesting character among the three sisters. She is the perfect, successful sister. Dianne Wiest is the struggling, temperamental artist. And Barbara Hershey is the impulsive beauty who just blows with the wind, having affairs with older professors, taking random classes at Columbia University because she has no direction in life, driven only by libido and vague intellectual interests. The sisters are well written and have believable sisterly dynamics. The less believable aspects of the sister characters derive from Allen’s perversity. For example, Woody Allen is Farrow’s ex-husband. After they split, Farrow encourages Allen to date Dianne Wiest. I don’t know anyone who would set their sister up with their ex-husband. In addition, Barbara Hershey has a secret affair with Mia Farrow’s husband. This is all weird bohemian behavior, but the film presents the affairs as if they’re just what adults do. The sisters have near incestuous relationships despite appearing to be normal, well-adjusted, upper-middle-class people (except Wiest, who is half crazy). The lack of boundaries of the women is odd, but Woody Allen presents them as normal. I think Allen has incestuous interests, and he normalizes inappropriate relationships by grafting his inappropriate feelings onto the women in the movie. This is a common trick of Allen’s. He puts his dark hedonism and mean-spiritedness into women characters. That’s why his female characters are very interesting. Much more interesting than the males. `,
    `Allen wrote a lot of great Oscar winning parts for women, but his films are not always kind to women. In Hannah…, Hannah/Farrow is mean to her mother, an old woman who cannot accept that she is no longer attractive to young men. I do not think Hannah, who is kind and empathic, would be so dismissive of this common experience of aging beauties. But I think Allen would. In addition, at one point, Dianne Wiest’s character remarks on how she is not sixteen anymore. I do not know any woman over thirty who thinks sixteen was their best year. But I think Allen thinks sixteen is the peak age of a girl/woman. The characters in Hannah and Her Sisters are well-written, but Allen assigns them a bit too much misogyny that exists in him, not the characters.`, 
    `As for Allen’s character, he is practically in a different movie. His scenes are all comedic, while most other scenes are dramatic. Allen plays a hypochondriac who thinks he is dying, learns that he is not, and then tries out several religions in search of the meaning of life while still running from death. Just as in reality, Allen’s character is a narcissist. His fear of death stems from self-absorption. His character explicitly states in voice-over that it is impossible that he can live in a city as great as New York and yet face death. I think the character and the person, Woody Allen, have some sort of megalomania that makes death hard to fathom. His megalomania is bizarrely tethered to his identity as a New Yorker. This is all played for laughs, but Allen’s comedic scenes are the darkest of all.`,
    `Hannah and Her Sisters probably shouldn’t work as a movie, but it does because of Allen’s ingenious insertions of his light-but-morbid comedic scenes between the dramatic ones. Without his scenes, Hannah… would be a tepid melodrama. With Allen’s scenes, it becomes great. Hannah… feels like an adult movie because the tension between comedy and melodrama feels a lot like the complexity of life, which has twists and turns, and inevitably ends one way. Allen’s character is obsessed with death, while the women are alive, actively keeping their family together, pursuing love or pursuing art. Eventually, Allen’s death-chasing character falls in love with Wiest, and he is alive again. Allen finds a woman to revive him. He finds a woman to suck the life out of. Aside from starting a new relationship with Wiest, Allen’s character recovers from fear of death by going to the movies, enjoying cinematic entertainment, and realizing that he should chase joy instead of death. Once again, Allen reveals his self-importance. Of course, the movies are a reason to live because Allen, in reality, made so many of them. Allen’s character, and Allen the person, like all narcissists, need something to feed their egos and beat back their insecurities. He and his character need the concept of the greatness of their profession, and they need sex and romance (with Wiest in the movie, and with his partner’s daughter in reality).`,
    `Hannah/Farrow is the nicest character in Hannah and Her Sisters. A bit passive aggressive, but very nice. (Later, Farrow would perfect her performance of passive aggressiveness in Woody Allen’s Husbands and Wives.) Farrow is so nice that she is marginal. Allen’s covertly mean character gets far more screen time than the titular character. In one scene, Allen’s character is depressed about the inevitability of death and he scoffs at the adults around him jogging in a park, trying to stay fit and, in Allen’s mind, stave off the decline of the body. Allen’s character is especially mean to a fat person jogging, because fat people couldn’t possibly have a reason to live. I think these are the real feelings of Woody Allen. Fear of aging, fear of death, and fear of fatness are the fears and insecurities of the narcissist and the pedophile. Allen is remarkably honest in his films about his darkness, and dishonest at the same time. He is direct and indirect. Sometimes the women characters in his films voice his darkness. Sometimes he himself, in character that is, voices his darkness, with comedy to lighten the dark. Woody Allen is so mean and petty. He hates old people. He hates fat people. He can neither grasp his own mortality nor the existence of other people outside of himself, so all of his characters are expressions of himself. This dramedy is a beautiful crystallization of his pettiness. This is a great movie, I think.`,
    `Side note: In Allen’s first scene, a television producer informs him that a sketch on child molestation is inappropriate. Another producer suggests that they televise a gay joke instead, because, apparently, homosexuality is one step below pedophilia in indecency. I take it that Allen is interested in whether pedophilia is a valid form of sexuality, and whether it is more or less acceptable than homosexuality.`,
    `Side note 2: Hershey offhandedly mentions how dental hygienists wore gloves because they were afraid of getting AIDS. Allen’s handling of gay content is worth investigating.`

    title="Warfare"

    releaseDate="2025"
    paragraphs={[
      `Some critics of Alex Garland’s ${TITLE_START} Civil War ${TITLE_END} complained that the film evaded politics. I take it that critics were particularly upset by its lack of overt politics because of how polarized American voters were in the 2024 elections. ${TITLE_START} Civil War ${TITLE_END} evades politics, institutional thinking and realism in order to present a cinematic myth about the amorality and complicity of photojournalists in violence. (The photojournalists in Garland-land want to get the shot, first and foremost. They are uninterested in justice.) By contrast, Alex Garland’s latest movie, Warfare, is “grounded” in a real mission during the Iraq War, yet it is no less abstract than ${TITLE_START} Civil War. ${TITLE_END} In ${TITLE_START} Warfare, ${TITLE_END} we (the audience) observe soldiers with no context about them. They are young men with few discernable characteristics. Their mission becomes a rescue mission after an improvised explosive device (IED) kills several soldiers and mortally wounds several others. We, the audience, hear what they hear. We hear the radio. We hear the explosions. We hear the silence of deafness after an explosion. We see fire crawling up a wounded soldier’s leg, and it is presented in first person, as if fire is crawling up our own leg. We see ourselves, beating back the fire and fighting to live. We do not see the institution. The young, handsome soldiers are cyphers onto which we can graft ourselves and our emotions. We do not see army generals. We do not see George Bush or Donald Rumsfeld. And, since this is not a David Simon production, the soldiers never wisecrack in a manner that comments on institutions at large (see David Simon’s Generation Kill for a slice-of-life depiction of war that manages to tackle institutions at large). We see that war is hell, but Garland does not insist on a political point. By being so grounded, Warfare is an abstract condemnation of violence, like ${TITLE_START} Civil War. ${TITLE_END} Garland seems to be a moralist thinker, not an institutionalist. There is a lot of value in Garland’s approach to storytelling. I think he wants to reach beyond the politics of the moment. Even his movie about real life events feels more like a cinematic myth than a historical event.`,

    paragraphs={[
      `This is one of those greatest-movies-of-all-time that make me feel dull for not particularly liking. I like the soundtrack. I like the famous jump cut from a match to a sunrise. I like how pretty everything and everyone (especially Omar Sharif) is. I just don’t have the masculine gene that automatically imbues stories of conquest and adventure with importance, romance, and nostalgia for a pre-modern era in which men could be men. This movie does for British people what the American Western does for Americans. It portrays the final arena of conquest for British empire, the Middle East, which is analogous to the Western frontier for Americans. T.E. Lawrence is a British officer who is a genius tactician who goes native and organizes Arab rebels against the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Lawrence despises the British because they are fat, and he despises the Arabs because they are too tribal and barbaric to form a modern nation. He expresses contempt for British imperialism, yet he facilitates British imperialism. He expresses a desire for a united Arabia for Arabs free of British rule, but he retreats to Britain as soon as the war is over, leaving dull nation building and imperial negotiations to the very old corrupt men he despises. He is an egotist in search of adventure and greatness so he goes native for a time until he realizes he’s white. The need for adventure and conquest that drives Lawrence does not exist in me. The need British people have to see the glory of empire does not exist in me. I just need a good movie.`,

    title="Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood"
    director="Quentin Tarantino"
    writer="Quentin Tarantino"
    date="04/6/2025"
    releaseDate="2019"
    paragraphs={[
      `In his revisionist history films, Tarantino enables audiences to process historical trauma by watching the perpetrators of violence suffer violence instead. That way, Tarantino assigns moral weight to his orgies of violence. In ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time’s ${TITLE_END} revisionist history of the Manson murders, ${SPOILER_START} Sharon Tate gets to live, and, instead, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio brutally murder Manson’s mostly female followers. ${SPOILER_END} The implications of the inversion of historical violence are more insidious here than in Tarantino’s other movies, I think. Here, washed up actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and washed up stunt man Brad Pitt restore their manhood and revive their careers by killing some Hippie chicks. The actual Manson murders exposed how a megalomaniac sociopath could exploit vague revolutionary promises of 60s culture in order to lead a cult to murder. Hollywood incorporated 60’s revolutionary culture, minus the revolution, into some of its products, like ${TITLE_START} Easy Rider. ${TITLE_END} The story of the Manson murders too became a story Hollywood could incorporate and retell. ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time ${TITLE_END} is Tarantino’s telling. In his telling, ${SPOILER_START} the evil hippies die and the middle-aged men of Hollywood save the day. ${SPOILER_END} The real Manson murders provide a perfect opportunity to critique the negative consequences of the Hollywood dream machine. Tarantino doesn’t do that. He celebrates Hollywood instead. He valorizes men with mid life crises. He glorifies femicide. Tarantino makes movies that are based on other movies or refer to other movies. It is not surprising that when he makes a movie based on real life events, he invents characters and events that reinforce the theme of the centrality of movies in culture, life and history. The story of the brutal murder of Sharon Tate and her baby is a story, first and foremost, that can be iterated on and fictionalized and converted into profit and twisted to mean this or that. Tarantino is an impressive storyteller obsessed with telling stories about how stories are told. He loves the storytelling power of Hollywood, and cannot quite critique it.`,
      `I have never seen a Tarantino movie that I haven’t liked (besides ${TITLE_START} Django Unchained). ${TITLE_END} I have also never seen a Tarantino movie that didn’t make me reflect on how fucked up Quentin Tarantino is. ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood ${TITLE_END} is no different. I like it, and Quentin Tarantino is fucked up. I am pleased that Tarantino is kind enough to ${SPOILER_START} let Sharon Tate live in his fictionalization of real events. I am less pleased that Tarantino indulged in his fetish for violence against women with his most unwatchable homicide scenes yet. ${SPOILER_END} There are a couple of male-on-male violence scenes in this movie, but Tarantino is most excited about setting Mikey Madison on fire. In addition to loving femicide, Tarantino is excited to have Brad Pitt beat up and emasculate cinema’s most iconic masculine Asian men, Bruce Lee. Tarantino is never politically correct. He is neither feminist nor progressive, and he revels in this, I think.`,
      `Brad Pitt’s character is the most interesting character in ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time, ${TITLE_END} not because of the character alone, but because of Brad Pitt. The movie suggests that Pitt’s character may have killed his wife in a brief scene in which his dead wife is shown to be irritating enough to provoke murder. In reality, Brad Pitt allegedly physically abused his ex-wife, Angelina Jolie, as well as one of his children. In reality, Brad Pitt is one of America’s greatest movie stars of all time, and, perhaps, an abuser. In the fiction of ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time, ${TITLE_END} Pitt’s character may be problematic, but he is also a hero, because he killed some girls. The tension between reality and fiction, the tension between self-defense and the brutality of murder, the tension between entertainment and morality, make ${TITLE_START} Once Upon a Time, ${TITLE_END} at the very least, interesting. Tarantino, the great populist, can make anything entertaining, be it revisionist history, racism or femicide.`,

    date="03/31/2025"
    releaseDate="2001"
    paragraphs={[
      `This is Wes Anderson’s best movie, I think, because it is his most human. It has all the hallmarks of Wes Anderson films that I have grown to dislike, namely, romanticization of elites, emotionally remote femme fatales, racial minorities as punchlines, and twee dialogue and plot contrivances. While typically frustrating, these Wes Andersonisms work here because the characters work. The characters are fleshed out and human. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is a narcissist who abandoned his family when his children were young, and tries to reinsert himself into their lives when he falls into financial ruin later in life. All of his children become emotionally stunted adults, as is common with the children of unloving narcissists. They all coincidentally retreat from adult responsibilities and return back to their childhood home at the same time that their father resurfaces. The psychology of the family structure checks out as believable. ${SPOILER_START} It checks out that a narcissist father picked a favorite child (Luke Wilson) to whom to devote all of his limited parental attention. It makes sense that an emotionally stunted man (also Luke Wilson) would remain in love with his adopted sister his whole life, never able to shake the romanticism of an adolescent. It makes sense that the children of a neglectful parent pursue excellence in order to get his attention, become prodigies while young, but fail as adults. The characters in ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums ${TITLE_END} feel real, so the emotions resonate. Except the scene in which Luke Wilson has a mental breakdown when he learns that Gwyneth Paltrow is promiscuous. That scene is powerful because of the Needle in the Hay needle drop, but not logical. ${SPOILER_END} Otherwise, the characters are fully human in ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums, ${TITLE_END} and anyone familiar with broken families can find something or some character to which to relate.`,
      `Wes Anderson is an amazing visual artist and an uneven writer. The visuals and the writing are both strong in ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums. ${TITLE_END} However, his picturesque visual art becomes sinister when the writing fails. Wes Anderson is known for the symmetry of his set designs and shots. Everything in the shot is in the right place. By translation (or metaphor), everything in the story is meant to be in the right place. The story and the characters in ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums ${TITLE_END} are tightly written. The movie is almost perfect. In Anderson’s other films, with more thinly conceived characters that are merely part of the set design and not particularly human, the picturesqueness becomes disturbing. One wonders what the picturesqueness implies in these other films. What, exactly, is in the right place there? Rich people in rich spaces? Poor people as servants? Racial minorities as punchlines? ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums ${TITLE_END} is a cute movie that works, but Anderson’s cuteness curdles into something bitter elsewhere.`,
      `Side note: After Luke Wilson attempts suicide, he returns home to find his love, Gwyneth Paltrow, in a tent in his room, listening to his records. This is blatant sad boy wish fulfillment. Your girlfriend doesn’t like your records, Wes Anderson!`,
      `Side note 2: Every character in ${TITLE_START} The Royal Tenenbaums ${TITLE_END} is a writer. In addition, the movie is narrated as if it is a book. This is one of the charming aspects of the movie. Cuteness works on me, sometimes.`,

      "Soderbergh’s latest film is the best film I’ve seen all year so far, aside from [TITLE-START] Companion. [TITLE-END] Soderbergh famously churns out pretty good to pretty great films quickly and efficiently, with a high degree of skill. His skill is on display here. Most scenes in this movie consist of people talking in rooms. Soderbergh’s camerawork makes these scenes thrilling. There’s a scene in which Cate Blanchett has a hostile therapy session with Naomi Harris. At first, whenever the camera shows both faces on screen, the camera is angled to make Blanchett appear physically higher, suggesting her dominance. Once Blanchett finally shows some vulnerability, we see a medium close-up of her. The shots are all controlled and deliberate and convey what they should convey. This is not A-level Soderbergh, but it is solid B+.",
      "The movie poses as a spy thriller, but it is really a story about a marriage. Fassbender stars as a British intelligence officer tasked with finding the leak of a top-secret computer program. His wife, Cate Blanchett, is one of four suspects. Movies, generally, are full of metaphors. This movie’s primary metaphor compares marriage to spying. Fassbender and Blanchet are partners working for the same agency, but they must keep secrets from each other for professional reasons. This mirrors how certain old-school heterosexual relationships are built by the concept of mystery. Cate Blanchett is always feminine and mysterious to Fassbender, and he can’t get enough of her. In an agency filled with professional liars who fail at relationships, they are the ideal couple.",
      "There is a problem with how this movie uses the spy thriller genre as a metaphor for marriage. Half of the metaphor is underbaked. The spy stuff is not as interesting as the marriage stuff. [SPOILER-START] There’s almost no action. There’s a point when Fassbender and Blanchett unravel the conspiracy they’re embroiled in and Blanchett says, “it’s all about us.” The plot about a rogue agent selling cyber-attack software to Russia is really just about Blanchett and Fassbender. Very few characters exist outside of Fassbender, Blanchett, and the few agents Fassbender investigates. Blanchett and Fassbender work for a major institution (the National Cyber Security Centre), and we see very little of it. [SPOILER-END] A better movie would discuss the relationship of Blanchett and Fassbender in relation to the larger institution. A better movie may even venture into institutional analysis. At the very least, a better movie would have action scenes as tense as the dinner party scenes. ",
      "Side note: Like many films, this film celebrates materialism and sociopathy. Part of what makes Fassbender and Blanchett aspirational is their town house, their fancy kitchen, and their elite professional jobs. In addition, their willingness to kill anyone to protect their loved one – their violence – makes their love aspirational.",

      "This classic queer indie film has one of the most iconic shots I’ve ever seen. River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves are two hustlers sitting at a diner. Phoenix is in love with Reeves, and Reeves only thinks of Phoenix as a friend. We see them as if we are at the table with them. Then we see them through the window of the diner. This is a simple and often used filming technique. Looking through a window can mean many things in film. Here, it can stand for how evasive Keanu Reeves is. It can also symbolize how we never fully see the ones we love. Personally, I am not interested settling what the shot means. I think the shot stands on its own, without meaning. It is beautiful, and so are many shots in this movie. Shortly after the Phoenix and Reeves leave the diner, we see them ride a motorcycle, Reeves in front, Phoenix behind. This shot is also beautiful. It captures how it feels to be young and pretty and with somebody pretty and with nothing much to do all day. The shots. The sets. The costumes. The actors.

In addition, romantic love does not offer him a way out, because his crush object, Keanu Reeves, [SPOILER-START] is the son of the Mayor of Portland, and is merely slumming it as a sex worker, prior to rejoining respectable straight society. [SPOILER-END] Phoenix is trapped. No love. No prospects. No support. Just an endless set of encounters with predators (including Reeves) who take advantage of him.",
      "[TITLE-START] My Own Private Idaho [TITLE-END] is one of those movies about the harshness of working-class life. Movies like these tend to have some aspect that softens the harshness. Family love, romantic love, upward mobility and/or a happy ending are possible softeners. This film doesn’t offer those. It offers aesthetics. It is very pretty. This film is loosely based on several Shakespeare plays, so the impoverished sex workers occasionally rattle off philosophical musings in iambic pentameter. The language and visual language of the film are highly stylized. The stylization is supposed to make the tragedy of River Phoenix’s character beautiful and palatable. Unfortunately, in reality, River Phoenix died of an overdose at the age twenty-three one year after the release of this film. It is hard to admire the stylized tragedy of the character he plays when his actual life ended tragically. My problem with [TITLE-START] My Own Private Idaho [TITLE-END] is how the fictional story interacts with both the reality of Phoenix’s death, and the reality of lives of the most dispossessed sex workers. Aesthetics and style are cool, but not moral.",
      "Perhaps I would like this movie more if it had something positive to say about queers, but I don’t think it does. The most sympathetic queers in this film are young, pretty, thin, and masculine presenting. The bad predatory queers, on the other hand, are feminine and middle aged. This is yet another reason I don’t think this film has its heart in the right place – another reason I can’t enjoy the excessive vulnerability of Phoenix’s body to the predatory camera. Aesthetically, this film is a 10/10. I bump it down to a 9 because it makes me uncomfortable.",
      "Side note: The sex scenes are emblematic of what I take to be the deep-seated anti-humanism of this movie. They only last a few seconds and consist of still shots in which the actors pose in sexual positions motionlessly. The sex scenes are like stills in a magazine. They are eerie and alienating. As if sex is just posturing and pictures, not a life-affirming act. Perhaps the film is commenting on the commodification of sex and sex-workers. Perhaps it is reveling in it. I veer towards thinking of this movie as an aesthetic exercise, not a humanistic one.",

      "Until [TITLE-START] The Hateful Eight, [TITLE-END] Jennifer Jason Leigh was known to be, perhaps, the best American actress not to receive an Academy Award nomination. She got Oscar buzz for this movie in 1995, but the nomination ultimately went to her costar, Mare Winningham. In [TITLE-START] Georgia, [TITLE-END] Leigh plays a drug addicted failed punk singer who has a strained relationship with her more successful folk singer sister, Mare Winningham, the titular Georgia. The movie is very independent, very slice of life, very wise about how siblings hate and love each other, and accurate about the lifestyles of failed musicians and the lumpen proletarians that surround them. Jennifer Jason Leigh is great. She is the best part of the movie. Her acting is nuanced. I don’t always like method acting, but I like how she does it. As much as I am impressed by Daniel Day Lewis, I don’t really like him. By contrast, I am both impressed with and enjoy Leigh’s 90’s era approach to method acting. She does the method acting tics, but does not lose touch with the humanity of her characters, and never seems to try to take focus away from the people and objects in the frame of the camera. She has a generous presence on film, even when her characters are selfish and melodramatic. I get the sense that Leigh is more committed to story and the profession of acting than to ego.",
      "When I first watched this film as a teenager, I identified with the obnoxious-drug-addict-dreamer Leigh plays, and hated her well-adjusted, middle-class sister. In my thirties, I still sort of hate the older sister, but I get her. And I get why the aging members of the Academy identified with Winningham and gave her a prize for putting up with Leigh. Leigh is an annoying adult who does not want the responsibilities of an adult in a capitalist system. Then again, neither do I.",
      "Side note 1: Another way this movie has changed for me over the course of the decades between my viewings is I have a buzzword called “narcissist” that I can use to describe Leigh’s character. Like all buzzwords, narcissist is more reductive than descriptive. Leigh’s performance is too nuanced to be reduced to a DSM/YouTube term. Still, the term applies. It probably applies to most musicians.",
      "Side note 2: This movie is too slow and indie for the TikTok generation, I think. ",
      "Side note 3: In my head, for some reason, I associate method actors with stream of consciousness novelists. Perhaps this is because method acting and stream of consciousness writing are 20th century techniques for exploring irrational roots of human behavior. Whatever the case is, I appreciate Faulkner like I appreciate Daniel Day Lewis. But I love Virginia Woolf like I love Jennifer Jason Leigh.",

      "This is a perfect high concept movie. A sniper traps a corrupt publicist in a phone booth in New York City and forces him to atone for his moral failings. Great idea that could be corny if poorly executed. Fortunately, Joel Schumacher, the crew, and the actors nail the execution. I liked this movie when it was released in 2002, and, with nostalgic grade inflation, I might love it now.",
      "The writer of [TITLE-START] Phone Booth [TITLE-END] originally conceived the film as a paranoid thriller for Alfred Hitchcock to direct. The movie Joel Schumacher ultimately directed decades after Hitchcock’s death is a little bit paranoid. The paranoia in the movie is over cell phones and other telecommunications technology. The villain in the film is the sniper on the other line of the phone booth call. He could represent the inherent alienation of long-distance communication. He could represent radiation, because ordinary people feared cell phone towers caused radiation in the early 2000s. He could represent many other things. Movies are metaphors for many things.",
      "To me, the most interesting aspect of the sniper is that he helps Farrell become a better person by putting on a live morality play that involves the cops and the press as characters. [SPOILER-START] The sniper releases Farrell from the threat of death once Farrell performs an uncharacteristic selfless act. Farrell’s moral victory and personal growth come at a cost of two men’s lives and dozens of total working hours of dozens of cops, but at least Farrell learned to be nice. [SPOILER-END] The “morality” of the evil sniper softens the paranoia of the film. Sure, phone calls with serial killers are scary. But you just might learn to be a better person.",
      "Just as the movie is ambivalent about its villain, I think it’s ambivalent about tech. As it turns out, the tech in this film is used to accomplish something old-fashioned and conservative – convince Colin Farrell to stop being a publicist who emotionally cheats on his blonde wife with a dark-haired Katie Holmes, and get him to be a good, domesticated family man. One way to domesticate and naturalize new tech is to use it to achieve conservative ends.",

One minute in real time is one minute in the movie. This film also has many other relationships to time. Due to the history of the screenplay, it grafts Cold War era paranoia onto early 2000s techno-paranoia. Finally, the film is a time capsule. New York City's last phone booth was removed in 2022, twenty years after the release of the film.",

Her performance in Miami Blues as a prostitute who falls for sociopath boyfriend from hell, Alec Baldwin, is rightly celebrated. She is good here. I think that Leigh is one of the better method actors who rarely chews scenery and tends to be generous with her costars and with the audience. She does not overact or underact. Even when she is showy, she does not appear to be showy. She is one of the most down to earth, believable actresses in film history, I think. This film is a decent showcase of her talent. Alec Baldwin is also good, but he may have just been on cocaine. As for the movie, it is a post-modern neo-noir film that makes fun of noir conventions.

[TITLE-END] Judi Dench is good in [TITLE-START] Mrs. Brown. [TITLE-END] The quality of the movie itself, however, depends on the movie watcher’s investment in British royalty.

John Madden’s directing is competent and personality-free. That is to say, this film looks about as slick as an episode of Succession. The castles, the gardens, the garments are all nice. But the most compelling part of this movie is the existence of the monarchy. You have to care about the emotions of a depressed Queen of England to care about this movie.

      "The first few minutes of this movie are frightening, apocalyptic, and gripping. A robot programmed to assist humans “wakes up” in the wild, unable to communicate with animals and unable to find tasks to fulfill. The beginning of this movie tricked me into thinking that a children’s movie could examine alienation and existential dread. [SPOILER-START] But, of course, the robot learns to speak animal languages and, for the rest of the movie, all of the animals speak English and behave like humans. And, of course, the robot learns to be human by becoming a parent to small bird. The first few minutes of this movie introduce darkness the next few minutes completely sidestep. What follows is a Disney movie that Disney did not make. I understand that children cannot handle certain material, but this film takes too many shortcuts and is not coherent thematically. Much like WALL-E, this film suggests that tech makes human society too comfortable and too wasteful. Humans have lost touch with humanity, and robots and/or anthropomorphized animals are the safekeepers of humanity. But how can a robot be a safekeeper of humanity while tech, in general, ruins humanity? In The Wild Robot, we witness humans destroy nature. Yet, the savior of a forest and its animal dwellers is a high-tech robot. The robot introduces tech to animal society by building a controlled fire. The robot even invents a United Nations of predators and prey, so that bears and beavers alike can inhabit a shared space under peace agreements. [SPOILER-END] But that’s what warring human nation-states with long histories of imperialism do. Not bears! If human society is so destructive, why anthropomorphize nature? Why make nature more human?",
      "The movies are very gloomy about what human society and modern technology have wrought. I guess children’s movies have to dilute this gloom with the idea of the redemptive qualities of love. This movie posits notions of existential dread and fear of mortality, and then distracts audiences with a familiar story about an outsider finding love, community and self-confidence. I admit that this movie got me a little choked up. How could I not feel for a robot that found purpose by parenting an adorable bird? But I feel manipulated and disappointed.",

Unlike Barbarian, this film, written and directed by Drew Hancock, is more thriller than horror. Enough said about the plot.

      "[SPOILER-START] Side-note 1: This film has a lot of ideas and poses a lot of questions. The most pressing question is what happens to human relationships when cyborgs are intimate partners. The companion bots in this film have false memories of meet cutes with their human owners. Several scenes of the movie suggest that the Hollywood meet cute is meaningless. Furthermore, I think Companion asks all human relationships are made meaningless by tech. There is not a whole lot of love between humans in this film, and the protagonist is a cyborg. The cyborg is more human than the humans. This anthropomorphism of a robot reminds me of The Wild Robot. That movie also suggests that technology has ruined human society, and the animals and the robots are the safekeepers of humanity. The animals and robots are our last hope because they are human, somehow. [SPOILER-END]",

      "Deadpool & Wolverine exists because Disney acquired Fox and can integrate Deadpool into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) now. Deadpool makes many meta jokes about corporate property rights that are sort of funny. All of the meta jokes in Deadpool are sort of clever and sort of lazy and cynical. For example, Deadpool jokes about the failure of MCU’s multiverse. The joke is based on how, for the past several years, Disney reduced all of the cosmic potential of the multiverse to an excuse to retcon characters and plots. The multiverse is a lazy way to staple together an endless amount of Marvel films fans feel obligated to see. Disney corporatized the multiverse. But Disney did not make sense of the multiverse. I don’t understand any of the time and space travel in this movie, and I don’t think the writers do either. This movie is a joke delivery machine, so the world building and the plot do not matter, so long as the jokes hit. As for the jokes, they are all meta jokes that are explicit ads for various corporations. This movie made a lot of money. My guess is it appeals to the inner smartass teenager inside of adults who thinks they are more of a rebel than they actually are. The jokes are juvenile, and tepid enough to pass Disney’s censor. The original Deadpool only pretended to be more dangerous than other superhero films. But it was always corporate. If the jokes had any bite and, say, critiqued corporations, maybe Deadpool would be about something substantive. But it’s not. More straightforwardly than most movies, Deadpool is about corporate profits. Nonetheless, this movie is pretty funny sometimes and better than the first installment.",
      "Side note: The screenwriting-101-character motivations in this movie are clear, but the character arcs make no sense. Deadpool’s arc is he starts out wanting to join the Avengers in order to make his life matter. He learns he does not need to be a superhero in order to matter. He just needs to love his friends. He learns this by saving the universe. Nonsense! Also, Wolverine is traumatized because he could not save the X-Men in his original universe. He gets over this trauma because he is told that if he didn’t fail in his own universe, he wouldn’t have succeeded in another one. This is a remarkably easy way to sidestep trauma. This universe is the best of all possible universes, so if bad things happened, it is all acceptable because the present always justifies the past. What a horrible concept. No guilt. No responsibility. No reason to do or feel anything.",
      "Side note 2: The coolest thing about Deadpool is his queerness. He jokes about pegging and he appreciates Wolverine’s body. However, this movie undercuts pro-queerness with a scene in which Deadpool stabs a guy in the ass, because queer sex is always violent and funny.",

The film contrasts the deep alienation of Baptiste’s character with the neighborliness and communal feeling of the black women in a hair salon in the scene that opens the film. Baptiste’s sister, played by Michelle Austin, is an empathic hairdresser who is capable of forming friendships, unlike Baptiste. "

Thus, the opening scene in a hair salon in which middle-aged black women discuss their relations with men felt very Brooklyn/Manhattan, though set in London. There is something that unites Afro-Caribbeans across the globe. This global diasporic cultural tradition isn’t enough to incorporate Baptiste into a community.

The score is stirring enough to feel tangible. I can tell that this is a mid-budget movie due to the hand held shots and mostly interior settings, but it looks better than big budget films."
    text2="Aside from the impressive sights and sounds, this movie is full of ideas that I’ll focus on for this review. This film critiques the idea of America by telling the story of a brilliant architect, Adrien Brody, who flees Hungary during the Holocaust, works low wage jobs, and eventually secures an architectural contract with morally dubious capitalist, Guy Pearce. Towards the beginning of the movie, Brody arrives at Ellis Island, and viewers of the film see the Statue of Liberty from Brody’s point of view, upside down. This iconic shot is a blunt but effective metaphor for the broken promise of the American dream. There are a lot of blunt metaphors in this film. I am happy with bluntness, and blunt metaphors in particular (see The Substance for another 2024 blunt metaphor movie). I love metaphors and symbols and synecdoches and so does director Brady Corbet. Adrien Brody is a symbol of the immigrant experience. His architectural projects are expressions of the artist’s need to create something permanent that outlives the artist. His solid and fixed architectural constructs are also a metaphor for the Jewish search for a permanent home. Brody designs a community center that looks like a concentration camp. The meanings of that metaphor are abundant."
    text3="[SPOILER-START] One of the metaphors of the film is overwrought. Towards the end of the film, Guy Pearce rapes Adrien Brody. This moment fleshed out Pearce’s character pretty well. Perhaps he is a self-hating homo for whom homosexual sex has to be degrading. He is both attracted to Brody’s Eastern Europeanness and repulsed. He is an unimpressive capitalist who figuratively and literally rapes his workers. The literalness of the rape is a story choice, and the idea isn’t strong enough to justify the upsetting scene. Everyone is critical of capitalists these days. We understand that capitalists are bad whether they are rapists or not. In addition, the rape scene would function better if no character ever commented on it again. That would be realistic. But the rape scene turns out to be pivotal in a manner that feels lazy and unearned. I don’t think midcentury white elites would take male rape seriously nor discuss it, especially if the victim is an Eastern European Jewish guy. [SPOILER-END]"
    text4="Side note: In the epilogue of the film, Adrien Brody’s niece is at some sort of retrospective of the career of Brody. She says to her audience, “No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.” This line has sparked some discussion by reviewers. My opinion is the line is precisely the kind of statement I’d expect a chic presenter at an art gallery to say; a simple inversion of cliché is automatically considered poignant and evocative. The film, and journey vs. destination line, are about the search for a home by Jewish refugees. The film is ambivalent about whether America or Israel are proper homes for Jewish people. The movie questions whether the destination of Ellis Island is worth the journey. It questions whether the journey ends. "

Just some questions/suspicions about director Boots Riley’s relations with women due to how he uses the Tessa Thompson character. The gender binary is well defined in this film. LaKeith Stanfield starts the film as an abstract thinker, wondering about his impact on the world. His girlfriend, Tessa Thompson is an artist living in the present, grounded and in tune with the community around her. LaKeith is narcissistic and succumbs to betraying his coworkers when offered a high salary. Tessa is moral and loyal. In addition to depicting this abstract male vs. earthy female binary, Boots Riley also subjects Tessa Thompson to physical and sexual humiliation in one scene. Her character has a performance art show in which she is nearly nude and audience members throw trash on her. The scene is less about her thinly written character and more about how far Lakeith has fallen. I think Boots Riley idealizes women and also has a humiliation kink."

    text="This is the lowest grossing movie of the franchise. Not sure why. It was an important narrative reset after the boring Mission II. This movie establishes the lore of Tom Cruise’s troubled relationships with women. Very rapidly, the movie explains away that Cruise is getting married to Michelle Monaghan. Monaghan, unlike Thandie Newton of Mission II, is white. The film also explains away that Cruise has a platonic relationship with agent Keri Russell, who, unlike Thandie Newton, is white. It doesn’t really matter who these women are, or what qualities endear them to Cruise. It just matters that this film plants the seed that Cruise will eventually not be able to reconcile having women in his life with the danger of his profession. As for the race of the women, that matters because of the movement of Cruise away from being a sex symbol over the course of the franchise. Mission II positioned Cruise as a James Bond-like stud, so it was okay then for him to screw around with Thandie Newton. Mission III presents Cruise with the possibility of marriage and domesticity, so Monaghan is more appropriate."
    text2="In addition to women as motivation, this sequel ups the ante of Cruise’s longstanding war with skyscrapers. He doesn’t just break into a skyscraper by hanging from rope. Here, he trapezes between skyscrapers in Shanghai using rope. Cruise’s battles against human constructs (e.g. buildings, bridges, roads, trains) are more compelling than his battles against, say, a cliff in Mission II. The image of man vs. skyscraper is symbolic of Cruise’s role in the IMF (No. Not the International Monetary Fund. The Impossible Mission Force!) He is responsible to the IMF, yet he can choose to accept or reject any mission. There is a hierarchy of authority in the IMF, yet Cruise constantly violates mission command. Cruise is the ultimate insider. He is a secret agent in an intelligence agency more elite than the C.I.A. with the ability to infiltrate any institution in any country at will. Yet Cruise cannot fully trust the institution to which he belongs. [SPOILER-START] This is the second Mission Impossible in which one of the bad guys turned out to be one of Cruise’s bosses at the IMF. [SPOILER-END] In addition, this film lays groundwork for the lore that Cruise cannot integrate himself into normal boring suburban life because of his profession. Cruise is a very powerful super-American and also alienated from everyone else. He needs to be a perfect soldier and his superhuman skills separate him from ordinary beings. He is above the institution. He is above everything and everyone, fighting for what he thinks is just. He is completely alone. His thin relationship with Michelle Monaghan, who, unlike Thandie Newton, is white, is not built to last."
    text3="Side-note: This movie has some Cruisian race play. [SPOILER-START] Cruise’s boss, Billy Crudup, turns out to be a maniac who intentionally armed terrorists and framed he and Cruise’s boss, Laurence Fishbourne, as the rogue agent. When Crudup explains his master plan to Cruise, he calls Fishbourne a “diversity hire.” I am not sure why this line is in the film. It can be interpreted various ways. Crudup is a bad guy, so his resentment of black people isn’t validated by the film, necessarily. Later on, after the plot resolves, Fishbourne apologizes to Cruise for being a hard-ass and Fishbourne literally says that he owes Cruise “reparations.” It is very bad word choice for a black character to tell Cruise that he owes Cruise reparations. This is a slip up, but a telling one. [SPOILER-END] The Mission Impossible series is mostly apolitical and therefore has no space or time to comment on anything as fraught as race. The series is about the power of the individual over and above institutions. Sure, Cruise works for an institution called the IMF, but he is above it. Sure, Cruise is a white man with American citizenship who flies into other countries to carry out espionage on behalf of the United States, but it’s not about empire building. It’s about saving the world from bad guys. Mission Impossible is uninterested in institutional thinking, so it is jarring when Billy Crudup’s comment stirs thoughts about institutional racism. That line, like the reparations line, was a mistake. It’s easier to accept that Thandie Newton was put in the fuck box and Monaghan was put in the marriage box if race is presumed and not stated out loud."
    text4="Side-note 2: Race aside, there is slight, but ultimately deceptive evidence of political thinking in this film via the Crudup character. In a convoluted way, Crudup wanted bad guy Phillip Seymour Hoffman to have weapons so the U.S. could use that as an excuse to launch preemptive war. This plot point may be a response to the War in Iraq, but it’s just plot. It’s a throwaway line that reduces “terrorist” threat to the conspiracies of bad men. Plot is not politics. It’s just meaningless pulp. Institutions. Plot. It’s all just setting."

    releaseDate="2024"
    text="This is the best of the three Robert Eggers movies I’ve seen so far. The Witch and The Lighthouse seemed more like inert art installations than movies. Nosferatu is still an art film, but it’s also pulpy and fun. The film is beautiful. Every close up, every movement of the camera, the black and white colors of some scenes, the blues and reds of others, the symmetry of the framing, even the fonts of the subtitles – it all seems deliberate and brilliant. As with any great director, I am not sure what Eggers is doing to make the movie work, but he is effective and I can feel his effectiveness. His movies never fail on an aesthetic level. Depending on personal taste, they can falter on a story level. I like the story here, but it has a limitation. There is no narrative tension except for watching the inevitable unfold. Everything is foretold early on. In addition, we are all familiar with the vampire lore this film makes no attempt to update. As in The Witch, I don’t think Eggers is interested in updating familiar mythologies. He reproduces them. Hence the lack of tension. There are no surprises. But there is a compelling depiction of a woman struggling with whether she is good or evil because she has sexual desires for a disgusting creature. The vampire symbolizes forbidden sexual desires, kink, BDSM, rape, rape fantasies, the complicity rape victims may feel they have with their victimizers, etc. This is all very familiar and all very well done. This may be the most beautiful depiction of vampires on screen."
    text2="Eggers’ horror films are nothing like Get Out. I don’t think Eggers uses horror to speak about current politics. It is refreshing to watch a movie and not think about politics."

    releaseDate="1959"
    text="I obviously have nothing original to say about this classic. I’ll just say what struck me most."
    text2="1) In the most famous set piece of the movie, a crop duster flies over and shoots at Cary Grant, who is running below in a field. I think the quiet moments right before this action scene are more tense and more interesting than the climax. Before the main set piece, Cary Grant stands across a dirt road from a stranger. Grant is a fugitive sizing up a man who may be foe or friend. The camera shows Grant. Then it shows the man. Then there’s a beautiful symmetric shot of the men looking at each other, with the road in the center of the frame running into the horizon. Then close ups of Grant from a different angle. The pacing, the camera angles and the sequence of shots create tension. Finally, Grant crosses the road to talk to the stranger. They exchange greetings and eventually the man offhandedly mentions it is peculiar to see a crop duster at that particular time. A bus arrives, which the man boards. Thin it’s Grant vs the crop duster. Amazing! "
    text3="2) The script has some anxiety over shifting sexual practices. Eva Marie Saint actively pursues casual hookups with Cary Grant out of lust. She is the pursuer and he is the pursued. This was too much for 1959 so she has to be slut shamed by Cary Grant when, because of plot stuff, he misunderstands her intentions. Eventually, Grant learns Eva Marie Saint was innocent the whole time, [SPOILER-START] and yet she apologizes for keeping her status as a secret agent a secret. [SPOILER-END] The film battles depicting modern romance with conservative values. Towards the end of the film, Eva Marie Saint reveals that she is unmarried in her late twenties because guys like Grant don’t believe in marriage. Grant insists he was married twice. “Exactly,” says Eva Marie Saint. This is the best line in the film. This scene domesticates both characters. They are squares who just want to settle down and get married to each other. Grant tells Marie Saint that his wives divorced him because he is boring. He will return to being boring after his spy adventure. They’re just gonna get a house and raise kids. All this is implied so that the famous jump cut that ends the film can imply that they are having sex again. The jump cut cuts from Grant pulling Marie Saint into his top bunk on a train, to the train going into a cave."

Carrey stars as a cable guy with borderline personality disorder who intrudes on the life of Matthew Broderick after hooking Broderick up with free cable (free cable was torrent before the internet). The film contains what counted as paranoia in the 90s: fear of people becoming antisocial by watching too much cable television. In the movie, Jim Carrey’s absent mother plopped him in front of a tv instead of raising him, so he grows up with poor understanding of how to interact with others. 90’s media paranoia is charming compared to far more apocalyptic American paranoia currently."

    date="01/01/2024"
    releaseDate="1998"
    text="Todd Haynes films are polarizing to me. Usually, I think the story of a film needs to work, and the aesthetics should serve the ideas. So I like Haynes films that are flourishing with ideas, like May December and Safe. I less like Haynes films that are more stylistic than interesting, like Carol and Far from Heaven. Velvet Goldmine is a highly stylized film that is also full of ideas. But I don’t think it reaches a synthesis of idea and image. The thin plot of the film is Christian Bale is a journalist seeking the whereabouts of a bisexual glam rock star played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Bale is probably a stand-in for Haynes, and Meyers is based on David Bowie. The film, in part, depicts Haynes’ own queer coming of age journey by way of sexual obsession with pop stars. This aspect of the film resonates because many young queer people substitute cruel realities with pop fantasies, and maybe discover their queerness due to an attraction to a pop idol."
    text2="There are a lot of big ideas in this film. It opens with a spaceship depositing baby Oscar Wilde on the doorstep of his parents with an emerald. This emerald makes it into the hands of Jonathan Rhys Meyers/David Bowie, and eventually into the hands of Christian Bale. The emerald symbolizes a longstanding connection between queers throughout history that inclines them to the arts. Fleshing out this idea of queer cultural inheritance, in one scene of the movie, Meyers/Bowie makes pop-star-like ironic, flippant and amoral remarks to the press that seem like Oscar Wilde witticisms. Contending that pop roots from Oscar Wilde is interesting. There’s no shortage of ideas in this film. It’s just that the ideas are served up by dream-like montage after dream-like montage, one music video melting into a dialogue scene melting into another music video. I like the ideas in this movie, but I don’t like the aesthetics because I don’t particularly like glam rock. But I do like naked twinky white boys, and so does Todd Haynes. There are reasons to watch this movie."

In the early 2000s, when I was a more militant leftist, I would have rejected this movie on political grounds. Today, I am charmed by this movie, and even the propaganda of the War on Terror era seems charming compared to the more nihilistic culture and polarized political culture of the present.

You can tell this is a book adaptation by the flurry of ideas that arrive by the third act. The movie opens with a question about how to date in one’s advanced years, and closes with observations about how British people see and misinterpret their elders who lived through World War II. Great work! On the downside, fear of aging is challenged a bit, but ultimately encouraged by this film. Family is reinforced. Family redeems having to age.

    text="Charming, witty, nearly perfect teen movie about the small problems of rich girl Alicia Silverstone at her high school in Beverly Hills. The movie is based on Jane Austen’s Emma. Alicia, like Emma, is a conceited but well-meaning innocent who decides to help people as a new way to be conceited, and makes a series of social mistakes while attempting to be magnanimous. Silverstone’s mishaps include giving bad dating advice to the new girl in school, misreading signs of affection from boys, failing her driver’s test and dating a gay guy. One of the charms of the movie, and possibly one of the flaws, is it feels episodic. It could have been three episodes of television, which is probably why this movie was made into a television show."
    text2="Side-notes: This movie is a time capsule and endless source of cultural references. 1) Alicia Silverstone remarks on how Marky Mark is only known for taking his pants off. Times have really changed for Mark Wahlberg. 2) Alicia Silverstone hilariously says “I object” in class in a non-litigation context. I think Legally Blonde stole this joke. 3) Silverstone refers to money as ducats. One of the hosts of the podcast The Read does this, and I suspect he watched Clueless. 4) The movie also has a 90’s minstrel show with the character played by Donald Faison. The film tries to rescue this when Faison eloquently argues about the validity of Ebonics as a language. The joke works. And besides, everyone was more openly racist in the 90’s, and that’s charming to me now for some reason."

The film’s cast of social misfits and its queer content frightened me because I was closeted then. I was enamored with the escapism of Hollywood and repulsed by depictions of failure. Now that I am in my thirties, I see that this is possibly one of the best films ever made. It celebrates cinema by, yes, poking fun at, but also humanizing one of cinema’s worst, yet most earnest pseudo artists: Ed Wood."
    text2="This film has a specific role, I think, in queer cinema because of its discussion of failure. Ed Wood, himself, was not queer, but he was a cross dresser who associated with queers, lowlifes and drug addicts. A lot of the jokes in the movie are jokes about the queers and has-beens that surround Ed Wood, but the jokes are in good fun. Sanitized portraits of queerness, like Will and Grace, present queerness as clean, successful and upwardly mobile. But the outsider status or queers (in the 20th century, before queerness became mainstream) is more associated with failure than success. Failure to approximate the glamour and heteronormativity of Hollywood. This film celebrates Ed Wood’s determination to realize his vision despite adversity. He can never get approval from a major studio, so he makes B-movies on shoestring budgets. Similarly, queers have historically been enamored with mainstream Hollywood images, while constructing alternative lifestyles outside of the mainstream."

The problem with planning sequels is many movies are incomplete. Dune was incomplete. This one is complete. Still, as much as I appreciate Chalamet’s arc, there is a flaw in it. After more than five hours of runtime between the two movies, it is unclear how or why Chalamet transforms from being ambivalent about his royal status to ruthlessly seeking power by means of violence and manipulation. In the blink of an eye, he becomes a sociopath. I think this is because the storytelling of Dune is plot driven, not character driven. The plot demanded that Chalamet change, so he did. I prefer character over plot, personally, but the plot here is very good. Watching various characters contend for power is interesting. It took two movies, but I finally understand Dune/Dune 2. It’s a sci-fi palace intrigue story. Game of Thrones in space."

This is not a fun movie on purpose. But it looks good. The actors are beautiful. The CGI is great. The shots are very nice individually. But the shots last too long sometimes. I prefer Dune’s meditative style of film-making in a small indie like Nomadland. For sci-fi, I like moving cameras, stylization over realism, and a sense of humor. There’s a disconnect between the heaviness of this film and the adult actors LARPing in silly costumes with toy swords."

The bad guy is fat and probably not straight. This is out of step with the now over body positivity “movement.” There’s a white savior narrative. There’s imperialism in the film, without any real critique of imperialism. There’s a bad emperor who merely needs to be replaced with a good one is all. Timothée Chalamet’s power comes from careful mixing of bloodlines. Enough said. Also, Chalamet has an innate understanding of the culture of the colonized “sand people,” kind of like how some white people “go native.” The “sand people,” who appear to be Middle Eastern and black, are one with nature, like how Native Americans are supposed to be. Any attempt to extract political or social meanings from this film leads to trouble, so you may as well not. "

The first movie probably paved the way for better products like Rome and Game of Thrones (Olden times are olden times. Fantasy or not, it’s just men in costumes with swords). We’ve seen it done better so Gladiator II disappoints if you expect high art. There are problems. The CGI animals are a downer, some of the actors don’t seem to have a handle of their characters, the plot is sloppy, and Paul Mescal’s hero’s journey does not make sense on a character level. But, as an unserious movie, it succeeds. It’s a mostly handsome looking movie and Denzel Washington is fun. It’s a good bad movie. So was the first one."

Paul Mescal’s character is vaguely motivated by some concept of democracy that may be more modern and American than ancient and Roman. Also, the characters talk about Rome and acculturation as if Rome were a modern nation state with a unifying national culture.

    text="Fascinating and peculiar high concept action film with sci fi elements. FBI agent John Travolta goes undercover by surgically stealing the face of comatose terrorist Nicolas Cage, only to get the tables turned when Cage wakes up and steals Travolta’s face. The film prepares you for how unserious it is with it's opening scene. Cage huddles in some bushes somewhere, aiming his gun at Travolta, who is riding a carousel with his small son at a carnival. At first, it seems that Cage lowers his gun because of the presence of the small boy. Turns out that Cage paused to take a sip of soda before firing, injuring Travolta and killing the boy. As in many Hollywood films, trauma is just plot. This highly stylized scene on the carousel is played for laughs. After an injured Travolta and his son fall off the plastic carousel horse in slow motion, the camera rests on the horse for a second, and it neighs. Does every hardened movie cop need a loved one to die within the first five minutes of a movie in order to establish character motivation? Maybe. Can an inanimate blood-spattered carousel horse say neigh? TBD."
    text2="There are not that many concepts in this high concept movie. Does the film use visual language to explore any of the psychological and philosophical implications of changing identity a la Ingmar Bergman’s 1966 film Persona? No. Does the film explore the nature of trauma? In a bizarre way, sort of. When he and his son were shot, Travolta acquired a bruise on his chest that symbolizes grief. When he first transforms into Nicolas Cage, Travolta asks the plastic surgeon to duplicate the bruise. [SPOILER-START] At the end of the movie, when Travolta gets yet more plastic surgery to restore his old face, he has the bruise removed, because he's healed now that the movie is over. Also, at the end of the movie, after killing Cage, Travolta adopts Cage’s son, who looks exactly like the boy Nicolas Cage killed. [SPOILER-END] So, is this film saying that trauma can be overcome with violence, murder, theft and replacing one kid with a new one? Not really. That meaning comes from interpreting the things that happened in this movie, and that’s not what you’re supposed to do. You already understand what happens in this movie before watching it because it’s the same as happens in every movie. Bad guy threatens nuclear family. Bad guy dies. Good guy wins. Family restored. There’s really no room for discussion of trauma within that template, even if the entire plot is about trauma."
    text3="This film may be stupid but it’s not shallow. Director John Woo is good at stuff I am not good at writing about. The sights and sounds are great and timeless. In addition, I think all movies, even good bad movies, are metaphors for something. I think Face/Off, like many movies of the 90s, is a metaphor for infinite potential. You can do anything in the movies, even take someone’s face, as long as you have the resources of the FBI and cutting-edge modern science. In the 90’s, white men could do anything. Everything was possible back then for them. In the movies."

He refers to the history of Western imperialism, culminating in America’s attempted colonization of the Moon before Communist Russia could get to it. Despite appearances, I try to appreciate films as they are, regardless of politics, but perhaps politics are unavoidable. Perhaps it is political to appreciate this movie. I think the watcher must bring knowledge of, if not belief in, certain images of American empire in order to appreciate this movie. Imperial iconography includes space travel as the final frontier, the awesome and intimidatingly massive institutions of NASA, the wife and kids waiting for dad to come back to their suburban home, and space filled only with white people. Some of the shots are nice and technically accomplished, but the ideas are so specifically American that I wonder if the appeal is limited to Americans who believe in America and the sanctity of the nuclear suburban family and the excitement of an imagined frontier. Movies make magic when there is a confluence of image and idea. If this film were as beautiful as Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, maybe the ideas would be more palatable. The ideas alone are not romantic to me, especially because the culture has turned the idea of space travel into a frontier for billionaires once they are done gobbling up planet Earth. Politics aside, good enough movie, I suppose."

A confusing plot happens and Davis recovers her lost identity and discovers a deep state conspiracy. The arc of the plot is clear, but the basic logic of cause and effect from one scene to the next is lost on me. I don’t really know what happened in the movie I just watched. I am so confused that I don’t know what questions to ask. I’d have to watch this movie many times to understand how stupid it is. Some story elements are secret agents, guns, water torture, casual sexual harassment, terrible wigs, many jokes about prison anal rape, horrid 90s saxophone synth, and Geena Davis racing a car on ice skates and winning despite being visibly slower and on ice skates. Academy award winner Geena Davis gives a committed performance and Samuel L. Jackson gives a Samuel L. Jackson performance. This film has a libido and shows Geena Davis in wifebeaters, in underwear and in the shower. Even Samuel L. Jackson gets a nude scene somebody asked for. I’m not complaining. During the climax when the villain explains that the whole plot hinges on the C.I.A. plotting terrorist attacks in order to force Congress to increase the security budget, I was afraid this 90s paranoia about the security state stood some danger of making this movie smarter. Don’t worry. It doesn’t. This movie couldn’t be stupider. Perfect 90s crap."

    title="Unforgiven"
    director="Clint Eastwood"
    date="12/12/2024"
    releaseDate="1992"
    text="Clint Eastwood western about assassin (Eastwood) hired by prostitutes to murder a cowboy who brutalized and permanently scarred the face of one of the women while she provided services. Solid, well-paced, efficient, straightforward, classic American filmmaking at its finest. The morals are clear. The bad men are bad (Gene Hackman). The good men are good (Morgan Freeman). Some men are in-between. Eastwood is a reformed bad man turned good by his now dead wife, turned semi-bad again when he is pulled from retirement by a $1000 bounty. Film portrays Eastwood and his rival Gene Hackman as exceptional men of the west who lived close to death because they do not fear guns. Most men are cowards, of course. In addition to gun-ness and Western-ness, film doubles down on American-ness when Gene Hackman humiliates and brutalizes an English assassin named English Bob, and chastises Bob about celebrating the Queen on Independence Day. Clint Eastwood is an American. And a man. Says the movie."
    text2="The gender politics are straightforward and predictable. Clint Eastwood is a man, therefore a killer, but he is good because a good woman loved him, and because the gentle wise sex worker who got knifed seems to fall for him, and because he does not have sex with the sex worker out of respect for his dead wife, who was at least three decades younger than Eastwood based on her tombstone (died at 29: God forbid she turn 30). Morgan Freeman’s “Injun” wife is silent and stern as she watches her man ride off into the distance. She says absolutely nothing. She is a good woman. The red headed sex worker who placed the bounty (Frances Fisher) is bad because she demands the disproportionate punishment of many men dying on behalf of her coworker. Fisher is perhaps Eastwood’s counterclaim against the ravages of feminism. Or a plot device to demonstrate what men do on behalf of women. Remember the days when men were men? And women were prostitutes."
    text3="As easy to critique the politics as to enjoy. This is very good film. Only flaw is ending. [SPOILER-START] A better ending has Eastwood killed. Instead, Eastwood lives and runs off to San Francisco to run a prosperous dry goods store. Anglo-American Dream. All of the sins and blood of the past washed off, dirty money converted into legitimate business. A better ending would not suggest there is something redemptive about violence. [SPOILER-END]"
    text4="Side note: bad guys exist so that audiences can revel in dark desires without shame. The camera shows a woman get beat by a bad guy. The camera shows a black man get whipped by a bad guy. The camera shows it. We watch it. And are good."

    text="Romantic coming of age tale about 15-year-old aspiring music journalist who travels with band to write cover story for Rolling Stone Magazine. Very implausible. Recognizable Cameron Crowe gloss of unreality. Band is quirky, instead of abusive. Bandmember’s philandering with sixteen-year-old played as sexy and cute. Everyone is adorable. The main character who kisses a passed-out girl on booze and Quaaludes just before her stomach gets pumped, is adorable. Some very clever lines. Crowe once again invented a memorable cliché. “It’s all happening” originates here."

    title="Queer"
    director="Luca Guadagnino"
    date="12/08/2024"
    releaseDate="2024"
    text="Written by Justin Kuritzkes and based on novella by William S. Burroughs, but true author is director Luca Guadagnino. About middle aged white expat drug addict Daniel Craig haunting streets of Mexico City, looking for brown and white twinks to bed who may or may not be queer and may or may not be sex workers. He always pays them. Craig, of course, uses brown boy Omar Apollo for sex, but falls in deep obsession and lust with white boy Drew Starkey."
    text2="Film is vague about whether Starkey has any affection for Craig. Perhaps Starkey is using Craig. Perhaps Starkey enjoys sleeping with Craig. Starkey always barely consents. He says, “alright,” and then politely grins. He has no personality. Starkey is empty. An idea to Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig never asks Drew Starkey any questions about his hopes and dreams because old letches require young people remain empty objects of lust on which to project their own ideas."
    text3="Film succeeds if you are interested in a community of feckless queer expats who have nothing in particular to do except chase boys. I appreciated the gay mannerisms of Craig’s sissy friends. Less appreciated their accounts of sex tourism. At times I felt compassion for middle aged gay men who do not seem to have access to loving relationships and are each plagued by some aspect of queerness, or the oppression of queers. Compassion evaporated during epilogue when old and dying Daniel Craig’s last thought is a memory of spooning a semi sex worker. I blame Daniel Craig for leading a life in which that was his greatest moment of intimacy. I blame Guadagnino for romanticizing this."
    text4="“Come as You Are” by Nirvana plays as camera zooms in on Drew Starkey the first time Craig sees hm. Reminiscent of much parodied scene of Can’t Hardly Wait when everyone at party stops to notice that Jennifer Love Hewitt entered the room. Analogous scene here is equally absurd Caucasian nonsense. I have suspected that there may be no underlying philosophy or meaning to Guadagnino’s flair for visual art, just libido. This film all but confirms that."

    title="Husbands and Wives"
    director="Woody Allen"
    date="11/29/24"
    releaseDate="1992"
    text="This was Woody Allen’s last decent movie (I don’t like Match Point. I don’t like Blue Jasmine. I don’t like Midnight In Paris. Etc). It’s supposed to be about two married couples that experience relationship issues, but it’s really about Woody Allen, who started publicly dating the adopted daughter of his partner Mia Farrow when this movie was released. This film explores Allen’s perversities indirectly. In the movie, his wife, played by Mia Farrow, is passive aggressive and the most unlikeable of the ensemble. Farrow is the one who cheats emotionally and pushes Allen away. In the movie, a young student of Allen, Juliette Lewis, is sexually aggressive and attempts to seduce Allen, and Allen declines. Allen’s perversities and actions in reality are displaced onto women in the film. Allen’s flair for writing confessional, intimate, funny, intellectual-seeming screenplays is apparent here, but so is his solipsism. None of the characters say or do anything that seems loving. They are all mean, petty and self-centered. They are all Woody Allen, I think. Characters that love themselves, maybe, and ideas, perhaps, but not other people. Allen casts himself once again as the guy at the center of the film who is overlooked and abandoned by the end. In reality, Allen got what he wanted. He married a child and had nothing left to express as an artist. He never wrote another good film."
    text2="There’s one good scene in which Juliette Lewis’s character critiques how Woody Allen’s character reductively writes women. In reality, Allen was good at writing women and bad at writing men. Allen was willing to write about women’s flaws. The men in this film, however, are victims of their sexual desires they cannot control. Victims of women and girls."
    text3="Watched this to see if Judy Davis deserved the Oscar over Marisa Tomei. Judy Davis is maybe slightly better here than Tomei in My Cousin Vinny, but only slightly, and not enough to make Tomei’s win as controversial as it was. Actresses can do something as minor as win Oscars while being second best to be controversial. Meanwhile, Allen married his daughter."

    director="Jonathan Lynn"
    date="11/27/24"
    releaseDate="1992"
    text="Pleasing, unchallenging court procedural as comedy (instead of as thriller; John Grisham). Was on television a lot in the 90s. Feels more like tv than film. Standard 90s elements: multiple extended jokes about prison rape, casual jokes about death penalty, terrible score. Marisa Tomei plays the girl who just wants to be a support to her man and get married. Tomei becomes an unexpected expert witness at climax of the film. Her New York (Staten Island Italian?) accent and classlessness supposed to make her expertise in cars palatable and winning. No idea what she was talking about when she testified car technicals. Seemed like Gandalf waving a wand. Magic. Everything ends well and there were never any stakes, even though two kids were falsely accused of murder in Alabama. Everything cute."
    text2="Tomei maligned for years after winning Oscar for this role. Tomei deserved to win over Vanessa Redgrave and Miranda Richardson. Have to check out Judy Davis in Husbands and Wives, who was the critical darling of 1992 Supporting Actress race."

VI is a little better, I guess. Either you are bought in to this artificial world of attractive nerds who are hyper literate in horror film language and surrounded by serial killers who want to re-enact murders from a horror film franchise within the franchise or not. I’m bought in."
    text2="Scream V and Scream VI are worse than Scream IV. Wes Craven’s loss is felt. RIP. V and VI seem more artificial because the physical world (the trains of New York City) are realistic. The artificiality of the first more suburban Scream films works. The clunky language. The goofy killer. Something’s wrong with the newer filmmaking. Something uncanny. Something mismatched. Maybe brighter colors are needed. A stronger departure from realism."

Stranger she is infatuated with has coma and, after classic rom com miscommunications and misunderstandings, she pretends to be fiancé of comatose man to his family. Delivers exactly what expected: charm and no real stakes. Even when Bullock rescues coma man from train tracks, soundtrack lets you know there no danger and everything going to work out. Some 90s cheese. Bullock is in love with snow globes because they “contain the whole world.” Romanticism glosses over not nice that Bullock lied to a family for weeks, but this far less sociopathic than later rom coms like How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. This film’s cuteness seems earnest, sorta. Plausible that a lonely woman would fall in love quickly because of idea of joining a loving family, but there’s something wrong with that and film uninterested in psychological complexity. Charming movie. Would just be released on a streamer these days."

Watching baby faced Chloe Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale in my 30s, I love it. Depicts Chloe Sevigny and her yuppie social circle exploring the Disco scene of New York in the late 70s. Very lived-in movie that, I imagine, accurately depicts Harvard grads who yuppified Disco and New York, based on clubbing experiences of writer-director. Sympathetic and critical of yuppies. Passing of an era in the lives of the young characters compared to the end of Disco. In one scene, characters have a discussion of The Lady and the Tramp that is predictive of how the love story in the movie ends (reminiscent of how, in Adaptation, Nicolas Cage says that stupid movies end with gun fight and murder, which is how Adaptation ends)."

Has hallmarks of legal thrillers: corrupt incompetent lawyers working for the evil corporation, underfinanced idealist lawyer working for the little guy, deep voiced promiscuous woman whose sexual past makes her testimony inadmissible. Matt Damon is working-class recent law school grad trained in ambulance chasing by Danny DeVito. He pretty much becomes social worker for ordinary folk of Memphis. Film explicitly narrates thesis that most lawyers are scum but some idealistic lawyers protect the rights of the powerless. Gamesmanship of lawyers representing corporations vs lawyers representing ordinary folk is endless fodder for legal procedurals and belief in the American system of arcane legalese. Just like how The Firm posits that idealistic Tom Cruise could become jaded Gene Hackman if he compromises his morals/the law one too many times, Rainmaker suggests Matt Damon could become corrupt John Voight. The Marxist in me argues this sidesteps structural critique/institutional analysis, but that Marxist is pretty annoying. Did not make that much money. One of my least favorite John Grishams. Too obvious. Still very watchable 90s film."

      "Another John Grisham legal thriller from the 90s. Grisham adaptations are all schlocky, unrealistic, perfectly enjoyable movies that resist analysis and compel watching. 90s legal thrillers mostly disappeared from theaters, and I miss them. 90s schlock is so much better than 2010s and 2020s schlock, e.g. Marvel, sequels, remakes, terrible Blockbusters. I want legal thrillers, comedies, and rom coms. I want the red veil of the 90s, the schtick that resisted naturalism, the slight paranoia that was better than modern apocalyptic thinking, the paranoia that was ultimately optimistic. I love how old the cars look in this film. I love how timeless and beautiful shots of the skyline are. And I am pleased that I can enjoy semi-patriotic semi-paranoid 90s cheese that I enjoyed as a kid, then resisted as Marxist teen, and enjoy again now in my 30s.",
      "Tom Cruise is a Harvard grad who accepts an offer from a Memphis law firm he soon learns is corrupt. As in other Grisham films, institutions (cops, FBI, White House) are corrupt, and an individual hero saves the day. Cruise not a pure hero. The film suggests that he could have been corrupted had he stayed at the firm. Cruise embodies the classic character trope of the poor boy running from his origins. He is born poor, his brother is in prison, and he married rich (Jeanne Tripplehorn). His rich wife is content to relinquish the perks of the firm because she always had money and does not covet it. (The dynamic is reminiscent of Leonardo DiCaprio/Cate Blanchett in Aviator, Jared Leto/Jennifer Connelly in Requiem for a Dream.)",
      "As in Jerry Maguire, black people represent something for Cruise. Towards the beginning of the movie, Jeanne Tripplehorn notes that the firm is “all white, all male, all married.” As she points out racial disparity, she and Cruise see a black kid on a sidewalk perform somersaults for pocket change. Cruise’s stunt double does multiple somersaults beside the kid and then hi-fives him, because Cruise is kind of down, you know. Pretty hip and with it. Later in the film, when Cruise despondent, he passes by the same kid on the street and not see him. Cruise is ensnared in corporate corruption, so his black card is revoked.",

I took a film studies class for two weeks before dropping out) pop music, which is new to Baker, I think. I think non-diegetic pop music is naturalistic at this point, given how much pop is ingrained in the lives of people and given the characters depicted."

Very little tension since plot is historical, and no moral complexity since everyone is against Nixon and Vietnam war. Spielberg never morally complex. Ends with silly cliffhanger about break in of Watergate, as if there will be an exciting sequel. Feminist, I suppose, because of Streep’s coming to power, but another movie about Nixon controversy, Dick, is more feminist because seemingly silly high school girls are the savior of the nation there, instead of rich girl boss. Much less entertaining than Dick. Run time is at least less than two hours. Watched this as Meryl Streep Oscar nomination homework."

No institutional analysis about when the Press is complicit (Iraq War, 2000s) and when it is opposed to the White House (Pentagon Papers, 70s). Another Spielbergian patriotic piece. No challenges.

Younger more radical me would argue that making American political system cute and quaint is insidious. In minor subplot, film blithely accepts president duty to support state of Israel and attack Libya. Quintessential liberalism of the 90s.

There’s a very sexy British playboy aristocrat played by Alex Hassell and a villainous social climber who’s jealous of those who are born rich, played by David Tenant. Jealous social climbers who are born poor is an effective trope, and maybe a conservative one. There’s a hypercompetent hypersexual black lady boss who voted for Reagan. There are likeable Tories.

    text="Celebrated Merchant Ivory production (Ismail Merchant = producer,  James Ivory = director, both = gay?) of the 90s. British, upstairs-downstairs, book adaptation, costume dramas dominated the Oscars in the 90s and have disappeared. Character study of a butler who is too committed to his work and British manners to object to Nazi leanings of his master feels very literary but translates well on film. I have not and will not read the book. Subtle observations about reducing life to work and repressing emotions. I may have watched this in my teens and forgot all about it because I was far more into “fun” films like Fight Club. Much nostalgia baked into watching an old movie about a historical moment. Instant nostalgia. Flecks of sadness. I am glad that Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins, the stars, are still alive."

Procrastinated for four years to see this because I knew it would be good but also knew it would be a “just so” film. Film set on a boat with minimal plot about literature starring mostly older female film veterans (Meryl Streep, Candace Berge, Dianne Wiest) is only for film snobs and gay men of a certain type (gay men who like Judy Garland). Not sure that the film does the thing it says books do, which is reach across time and space and give people a sense of a unified humanity. I liked the film, but films for film snobs no longer give a sense of identity, just a sense that they need to be more popular or they will disappear. Bergen is hilarious."

    date="06/23/24"
    text="Took years to get to this one since it combines three things I hate – sports, capitalism, and little guy who succeeds against big business. Watchable and pleasant if you let yourself watch a rom com/sports story sandwich. Tom Cruise is Jerry Maguire sports agent who has moral crisis and writes manifesto about having less clients and making less money. Vague act of petulant moralizing in corporate setting gets him fired, and Renee Zellweger follows broke Tom Cruise to independent company despite being single mother. [SPOILER-START] Cruise’s business succeeds, his romantic life blossoms and he gets a kid (Renee’s) for free. [SPOILER-END]"
    text2="Very good performance from Cruise. Scenes in which he is charismatic predict his later reputation for manic and cult leader energy. His acting style is specific and a little weird and manic and earnest and honest and dishonest at the same time. Sometimes he seems like he’s acting against Cuba Gooding Jr, sometimes he seems like he is acting against ideas in his head even when giving eye contact to Cuba. Cruise’s specific acting style works well here and in most of his films."
    text3="Signature Cameron Crowe insidious cuteness. Underlayer of liberal 90s “cute” racism. College educated Regina King suddenly becomes violent and ghetto in her final scene. Gooding Jr. gives Cruise permission to say things like “show me the money” and “shoplift the pootie.” Lots of 90s cheesy lines. “You complete me” and “you had me at hello” also come from here. Movie earnestly wants to promote love and optimism. But the cynicism of the world is smoothed over with jokes and cheesiness. Adult workspaces seem so naïve and childish in the movies."
    text4="Politics not good. Many scenes of single middle aged women’s group where they say reasonable things about valuing female friendship played for laughs. Women need Tom Cruise, who interrupts a feminist lady-gathering to demand that Zellweger take him back. She broke up with him because they couldn’t articulate why they loved each other. They get back together because he finally articulates that he wants a girl and free child to talk to when Cuba Gooding Jr. scores a touchdown and secures financial success. This is good enough for Zellweger. Contradiction of celebrating “small business” in a major film starring bankable Tom Cruise is so glaring that hardly worth mentioning. Acoustic guitar and soundtrack melt one scene into another. Music video vibe of director Cameron Crowe.  This is what 90s optimism looked like, compared to the 90s pessimism of Reality Bites or The Simpsons."

Crowd at Magic Johnson AMC in Harlem very happy when Martin Lawrence’s son shot someone in the head and then saluted his father. Despite corrupt cop story line, patriotic and militaristic. No attempt to comment on stand your ground laws despite death of Trayvon Martin. Violence exists alongside very cute domestic scenes of men competing for authority over grill and wife forcing husband to be vegetarian."

The political and moral intent of the show is clear, well intentioned and inoffensive to people like me who went to liberal universities. Peak tv for liberals.

I appreciate the interracial love story but am also put off by how much this is in vogue. The well-meaning white liberal rich family whose patriarch is on the board of the hospital is very enviable. Must be nice to run things and be kind to one’s social inferiors whose civil rights you support. Like most tv, this show is a melodrama.

I’m surprised that Linklater has a scene in which the newly self-actualized Powell has sex with his girl next to a dying body, both turned on by their reckless dangerous actions. Many Hollywood films are sociopathic and I though Linklater might critique this. He just revels in it. The philosophical component, I guess, is existentialist.

Embarrassed to say that the score and the manipulative ending brought tears despite my resistance. Maybe it’s okay that films like this obscure poverty and suffering with fantasy. But maybe not because of the nefarious Weinstein behind the scenes. Discussion of older woman’s deadbeat dad, romantic failures and inability to be a permanent figure in the boy’s life is compelling. Some argue that Fernanda Montenegro should have beaten Paltrow for Oscar and I agree. (Paltrow should have won for Royal Tenenbaums.) Been meaning to watch this movie for 15 years, ever since I started exploring film through the Best Actress Oscar (I moved on to directors later).

  <Review    title="Southland Tales"
    text="I would give it a 5 but I gave it a 6 because it takes big swings, attempting to comment on way too much – police state, radical leftists, feminists, corporations – with a confusing sci fi plot. Some jokes work. Most don’t. In interviews, director Richard Kelly is oddly childlike in demeanor. Film seems like it was written by someone in high school."

  <Review    title="Miss Congeniality"
    text="Pretty funny. Sandra Bullock is perfect. I was wrong to dismiss movies like this in my youth. Perfect set up in which FBI must use resources on training agent for beauty pageant. The jokes and set up could have been pushed further. Some don’t work. Several gay panic jokes and a really bizarre scene making fun of militant lesbian pageant finalist. And yet, the movie is kind of gay friendly. Black FBI boss and Benjamin Bratt wear dress in scene in which computer program generates images of agents in pageant dress. Opportunity to shame homely women, show men in drag (appealing to gay and anti-gay gaze) and objectify Sandra Bullock. Nice legs on black guy."

    text="Breezy meaningless film about high stakes poker with no stakes. Great Ed Norton performance. John Malkovich does a silly Russian accent. Gretchen Mol plays the Michael-Mann-girl type who tries to domesticate the man obsessed with his work."

    text="Irish film about neglected girl who experiences love for the first time when she spends a summer with childless family members. Ending is heartbreaking. Reminds of the time I didn’t want to go back home when I visited family in Florida."

    text="I have not finished Jaws but reminds me of Jaws. Standard and well-done hero’s journey. This kind of blockbuster is just not that compelling to me. I wish the acting were naturalistic instead of stylized and melodramatic in a specifically Japanese way. Too psychologically simple?"

  <Review    title="The Usual Suspects"
    text="Very stylistic. Very plot driven. Amoral filmmaking. Just plot. Just clever twist. There’s a barely tertiary female character to give Gabriel Byrne some heart. Slick non-humanistic film making at its 90s finest."

  <Review    title="Jaws"
    text="The jokes are cringe. The characters are line drawings. The doting wife bores and unnerves me (like she belonged in a Robert Altman movie and is trapped in a Spielberg movie; looks like Shelley Duvall). But the opening was solid. The scenes on the boat gripping. Perfect blockbuster with that lack of real humanity that permeates Spielberg films. I am slowly beginning to appreciate Spielberg despite how there’s very little of me that resonates with his instincts. He is the best director and I can’t help but be impressed."

    text="Wish high concept original films like this were still made. Weird how Keanu Reeves can act his ass off in the screaming match with Pacino and fumble dialogue in a scene with Charlize. When Keanu is “bad,” I don’t really mind. He's just a movie star, I guess."

  <Review    title="Ocean’s Eleven"
    text="I watched this because SFennessy and ADobbins of The Big Picture podcast ranked this high among Soderbergh films. I think that Sex Lies and Videotape is the only Soderbergh film that does not seem artificial to me. He makes you pay attention to the construction of the film and the editing techniques and references he plays with. Beautiful scene of the guys looking at a water fountain at night and for a second it looks like day as Claire de Lune plays. Nice to see so many beautiful actors at the peak of their power as movie stars. The last generation of movie stars as we once knew them. I think that the hosts of The Big Picture have a much higher appreciation of MOVIES that are very white and divorced from reality than I do. The scene in which Bernie Mac pretends to play the race card in order to enable Matt Damon to play a bumbling white person and trick the casino owner was unfunny enough to be offensive. That white people find black people complaining inherently funny is the offense, I think. Fakeness of complaint makes it worse. Waste of Bernie Mac. RIP."
