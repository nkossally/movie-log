        title="Reacher (tv)"
        text="Ex-military vigilante commits many murders to get at bad guys. Dirty Harry fantasy mixed with attempts at representing groups other than white men with well-drawn black Harvard grad police chief and tough lady cop. Refuses cavity search and prevents someone from being raped in prison. Hints of homophobia. Good show."

        title="Logan Lucky"
        text="Solid comedy written by wife of Soderbergh. Adam Driver good at being weird character actor. Meaningless fun."
      />
      <Review
        title="Femme"
        text="Uncomfortable but successful discussion of a closeted white gay chav who attacks a black drag queen, ultimately concluding that the white guy is more broken and worthy of pity. Not visually interesting. The black actor seemed to be a boring drag queen to me. Spoiled by American Drag Race?"

        title="I Care A Lot"
        text="Sociopath exploits old people and defeats the Russian mob boss of one of her elderly victims. Overt discussion of the sociopathy of capitalism. Poorly done final minute, in which the main character is shot. Rosamund Pike hilariously transitions between adorable cheery fake healthcare provider and icy calculator. Pike’s take on white woman sociopathy is distinct from Cate Blanchett’s in Tar. Blanchett’s sociopathy never disappears. Pike is at least as good as she is in Gone Girl. Movie too cynical to be successful? "

        title="Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning"
        text="The monster is AI but this franchise has no idea how technology or anything in reality works. Silly fun. Perfect. 10/10"

        title="Fabulous Baker Boys"
        text="Such a simple movie that would never be in theaters today."

        title="Death Becomes Her"
        text="Funny. Perfect. When I was younger I was not able to receive Meryl as a villain. Now I am. She’s naturalistic, even in a campy villainous role."
